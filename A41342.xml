         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is uÅ¿ual for thoÅ¿e that appear in publick, to prefix Å¿ome great name before them, that they may gain the greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teem, and that the army of their words may be looked on to be more conÅ¿iderable, when they have Å¿o valiant a forlorn: It is no more then needs
<pb facs="tcp:93651:3"/> that Å¿ome Coats have Å¿upporters, eÅ¿pecially when there are notes of abatement in the charge; AmongÅ¿t whom I rank my Å¿elf, who had I not had a copious Å¿ubject, Å¿hould have deÅ¿ired invention; who now only deÅ¿ire that my labour may find protection under your wing; and the more confident I am, that I Å¿hall not be fruÅ¿trated, when I conÅ¿ider who it is that is here preÅ¿ented to your LordÅ¿hips view.</p>
            <p>I confeÅ¿s a fair front may be Å¿et before a mean Cottage by an unskilfull Builder; and I may rank your honourable Name as a Patron to that, which for its own merits Å¿ake is not worth your LordÅ¿hips reading, much leÅ¿s your protection: But I Å¿hall not Å¿o much deÅ¿ire that the faÅ¿hion of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument be obÅ¿erved by you, as the materials whereon it is built; and then I promiÅ¿e my Å¿elf this, that though you Å¿hould not like the frame of the building, yet you would not have the Timber loÅ¿t. What I Å¿aw in her LadiÅ¿hip (whom I here preÅ¿ent to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) uÅ¿efull for Å¿uch a work as this, I pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mine own obÅ¿ervation. Another that could have built this Monument in more Å¿tate, might have found hewn Å¿tones fitted to his hand; though thoÅ¿e, which for their
<pb facs="tcp:93651:3"/> curious workmanÅ¿hip, I knew not how to place right, are lefr out, not becauÅ¿e I Å¿ee them not, but becauÅ¿e I could not place them to their worth. And having built this Å¿mall Pile of her vertues, not knowing to whom Å¿he more of right belonged then to your Å¿elf, I have made bold to give it your LordÅ¿hips SuperÅ¿cription.</p>
            <p>You may Å¿ay to me in this attempt, as <hi>Aeneas</hi> did to <hi>Dido,</hi> when Å¿he deÅ¿ired a Narration of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Wars,
<q>Infandumâjubes renovare dolorem;</q> That I bring you again to the houÅ¿e of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and open the Å¿luces of thoÅ¿e eyes that were almoÅ¿t Å¿hut; and for this cauÅ¿e (did I not hope that the profit you may receive, will countervail the Å¿orrow which you will find in the renewing of her remembrance) I Å¿hould have been Å¿ilent: but if the Å¿treams of your teares waÅ¿h your Å¿oul, and your Å¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for her terminate in Å¿orrow for Å¿in, I Å¿hall not think my labour either prepoÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or in vain: if the flood turn inward, I am willing to clenÅ¿e and open, rather then to Å¿top or interrupt the free paÅ¿Å¿age.</p>
            <p>When <hi>ConÅ¿tantine</hi> had Å¿hewn the <hi>PerÅ¿ian</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93651:4"/> King the glory of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Å¿tately Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of deceaÅ¿ed Emperors, he looked on them, and Å¿aid, <hi>Mira quidem haec, Å¿ed ut video, Å¿icut in</hi> PerÅ¿ia, <hi>Å¿ic</hi> Romae, <hi>homines mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuntur;</hi> though you have men of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, yet I Å¿ee as we do in <hi>PerÅ¿ia,</hi> Å¿o at <hi>Rome</hi> all dye. I hope your LordÅ¿hip judged Å¿o of her; that though Å¿he was pure, yet Å¿he was brittle; though precious, yet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. The Oak in time will decay as well as the Willow; and the Å¿trongeÅ¿t tower, though a Å¿torm will not, yet a thunderclap will Å¿hatter it to pieces: <hi>Fragilem frangi, &amp; mortalem mori,</hi> to Å¿ee a glaÅ¿s break, or a Candle burn to the Å¿nuff, is no new thing.</p>
            <p>It is a mortifying conÅ¿ideration to look over a dead wife, or a dead child; but we who have corruption Å¿o apt to live, had need Å¿ometimes be told that our frame is Å¿ubject to dye: this conÅ¿ideration will Å¿till home-bred Wars, namely, to be told of an invaÅ¿ion; the fleÅ¿h will Å¿ooner be mortified, and the Å¿pirit will endeavour to be Å¿upreme the rather, when it conÅ¿iders that it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable.</p>
            <p>It was Å¿aid of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that when he came to <hi>Achilles</hi> his Tomb, he wept, becauÅ¿e he had not a <hi>Homer</hi> to Å¿et him forth. For
<pb facs="tcp:93651:4"/> this purpoÅ¿e it is reported, that <hi>AlphonÅ¿us</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> King of <hi>Cicily,</hi> kept <hi>Panormitan</hi> the Poet, that he might immortalize his name; and though that cannot be expected from me, what another might have writ, who had known her longer; yet Å¿omething I have obÅ¿erved according to my knowledge; nay, I have Å¿een more in her then I know how to expreÅ¿s here: For he had need be a neat Limner that draws a beauty to the life; and he had need underÅ¿tand the tongue, that attempts to expreÅ¿s her language, and Å¿tands need to have trod in her Å¿teps too, that goeth about to deÅ¿cribe them.</p>
            <p>When I conÅ¿idered the remarkableneÅ¿s of the providence, the noiÅ¿e that it made, and how loud it Å¿poke to us all, I thought, God would not have it forgot: and when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered that in Å¿o Å¿hort a time, the memory of that great Å¿troke was Å¿omething more dark, and ready to wear out, I undertook this work, which I formerly did not intend; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to build a Monument, whereby <note n="*" place="margin">The mother and the Å¿on both dying in a fort-nights Å¿pace.</note> their names, whoÅ¿e perÅ¿ons the Lord hath taken to himÅ¿elf, Å¿hould not be forgotten; and it is becauÅ¿e we have almoÅ¿t forgot to read my <hi>Ladies ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93651:5"/> that I put them in print; had our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories been better to have retained more, I Å¿hould have Å¿poken leÅ¿s, if any thing at all.</p>
            <p>It Å¿eems God Å¿aw that we had need of Å¿uch a great affliction, or elÅ¿e he would not have doubled it; and if the Å¿mart of it do not make impreÅ¿Å¿ion, he can plat another cord, and be more Å¿evere: Oh therefore that what we have felt, might make us Å¿ay, <hi>Spare Lord, and we will do Å¿o no more.</hi> Could we but find the pleaÅ¿ures of Å¿in to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the torment for Å¿in, we might be leÅ¿s cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious: and if it were Å¿o, that brethren in iniquity who have drawn us to Å¿in, could get as much favour hereafter as they get us affliction and Å¿orrow here, we need not be much circumÅ¿pect: but to conÅ¿ider that our very companions, nay, our very Tempters will be our accuÅ¿ers; and he, for whoÅ¿e Å¿ake we became tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ors, will betray us: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is more rational to truÅ¿t God in a way of holineÅ¿s, who will never forÅ¿ake us, then man in a way of Å¿in who will not aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t us in time of danger.</p>
            <p>I have ground to believe, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip had not eÅ¿pouÅ¿ed her perÅ¿on only, but her graces; and did not love her only for external accompliÅ¿hments, but for her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:93651:5"/> zeal. What I here publiÅ¿h, is no more then you knew, no more then you approved of: I wiÅ¿h none that are religious, were more unequally yoked. I have Å¿een Å¿ome husbands <hi>canes in praeÅ¿epibus,</hi> or like the Scribes and PhareÅ¿ees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 13. who Å¿hut the Kingdom of heaven, &amp; will neither enter in themÅ¿elves, nor Å¿uffer them that are entring to go in: had it been Å¿o with her, Å¿he had not been Å¿o forward: Å¿he hath often reckoned it a mercy which Å¿he received from your LordÅ¿hip, as well as from her heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that you did not offer to quench, but kindled the fire of her zeal; that you did not pull off the Chariot wheels, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oil them; that you did not conÅ¿train her to tread in thoÅ¿e Å¿teps which were not Å¿uitable to her Å¿peed, nor force her to wear that Å¿hoe which did not Å¿it eaÅ¿ie on her foot: conÅ¿idering that it is uncomfortable for one in a race to be clogged with any burdens but neceÅ¿Å¿aries. I deÅ¿ire the Lord Almighty to bleÅ¿s you with the Å¿ame bleÅ¿Å¿ing; that as they have fixed their reÅ¿olution for heaven, they may not be pul'd back by thoÅ¿e that draw in the Å¿ame yoke with them; and that they may never be conÅ¿trained to Å¿peak in a language they underÅ¿tand not;
<pb facs="tcp:93651:6"/> though there are many voices, yet none of them is without Å¿ignification; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 10. They in this Å¿enÅ¿e have been uÅ¿ed to Å¿peak in their mothers tongue; and though it Å¿hould Å¿eem barbarous to others, yet to Å¿peak in an unknown language, would make them Barbarians to themÅ¿elves. I hope the Lord who hath made you a father, hath given you a fathers heart that is tender; not only to encourage their graces, but to bear with their infirmities. And I hope, and have te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿timonies to convince me, that Å¿eeing the Lord hath bleÅ¿Å¿ed you with Å¿uch Children, you will not be unwilling that they Å¿hould beÅ¿tow themÅ¿elves on the Lord.</p>
            <p>As to my Å¿elf and preÅ¿ent work, it is my firÅ¿t fruits, which had not been ripe yet, but that it was Å¿o Å¿oon Autumn with her; and becauÅ¿e it grows in your LordÅ¿hips Å¿oil, I cannot but dedicate it to your Å¿elf; wherein I do not deÅ¿ire to be <hi>Theologus gloriae,</hi> but <hi>Crucis:</hi> As I dare not be found Å¿inning, Å¿o I would not be found idle when my Saviour comes. Perhaps Å¿ome who loved her not, will cenÅ¿ure me for what I have Å¿aid; and thoÅ¿e that deÅ¿ired her vvorth Å¿hould be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, vvill be angry becauÅ¿e I have put it in print; yet this is my comfort, <hi>Non ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nota</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93651:6"/> 
               <hi>cano; innumeros prompÅ¿it Britannia teÅ¿tes:</hi> her light was not laid under a buÅ¿hel; thoÅ¿e that did not Å¿hut their eyes, might have Å¿een as much as I have Å¿poken; theÅ¿e who knew her would have believed themÅ¿elves, though I had not Å¿poken: and thoÅ¿e that did not know her, I could deÅ¿ire them to believe me, except they would have me to diÅ¿truÅ¿t them, when they Å¿peak truth. And if I be cenÅ¿ured, it is no more then I would freely undergo, rather then her dear name Å¿hould be forgot. ThoÅ¿e that will Å¿peak evil, perhaps may have Å¿ome come after them, that will do as much for them. <hi>Valla</hi> condemned all that writ before him; (which could not be wiÅ¿dome, except he had been Å¿ure to have been the laÅ¿t that had come upon the Å¿tage) <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raÅ¿mus</hi> comes after, &amp; doth as much for him.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93651:13"/> or elÅ¿e they would take up lodging with the Å¿wine; Beggars muÅ¿t hunger Å¿ometimes, or elÅ¿e they will not ask; nay, they muÅ¿t be denied, or elÅ¿e they will not be importunate. Thus our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father laÅ¿heth his children where he would have them obey, and cauÅ¿eth the Sun to Å¿et, and darkneÅ¿s to overtake them, when he would have them return home: Indeed, the Pinacle of honour in the world is Å¿uch a Å¿lippery place, that when Satan had Å¿et ChriÅ¿t there, he thought he could caÅ¿t him down with more eaÅ¿e, and make his fall the greater; and when he had let him Å¿ee the kingdomes of the earth, he thought he could more eaÅ¿ily keep hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of his Å¿ight; when he had given him to know the world, he thought by that means he could Å¿ooneÅ¿t cauÅ¿e him to forget himÅ¿elf; and when he had mounted him Å¿o high, he thought it the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to make him overlook his own happineÅ¿s. Now if Satan durÅ¿t attempt to aÅ¿Å¿ault the Lord, he is not without Å¿trong hopes of conquering the Servant; therefore leÅ¿t we Å¿hould be oblivious of our frame and nature, our Father gives us a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum;</hi> and that we may know our Å¿elves, he lets us Å¿ee our faces in a glaÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>Every image of death is but a repreÅ¿entation of our own perÅ¿ons, and tells us who we are.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93651:13"/> our diÅ¿Å¿olution: And indeed if a Saint be but looked through we may Å¿ee from the womb to the grave, from thence to heaven; not not only the mark, but the way is characterized in a Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual mans life; not only the good beginning, but the happy end in a Å¿piritual mans death. As the informations we have by Saints lives are uÅ¿efull, Å¿o the admonitions we have by their death are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. I do not know any that ever lived, but had need be told Å¿ometimes that he muÅ¿t <hi>dye:</hi> never was there any that became familiar with the fleÅ¿h, but Å¿hould be told he muÅ¿t leave his companion: and there was never any Å¿o unanimouÅ¿ly joyned together, but it was needfull that Å¿ometime he Å¿hould hear of their putting aÅ¿under; for which purpoÅ¿e theÅ¿e words are very uÅ¿efull, for they are the unyoking of an honourable pair, the looÅ¿ing the marriage bonds of the Parents of the faithfull, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you may Å¿ee, though no man may, yet God may put aÅ¿under, what he himÅ¿elf hath joyned together. <hi>Abraham</hi> took him a wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 29. and here God takes her from him, and the more juÅ¿tly, becauÅ¿e Å¿he was his gift. True, HouÅ¿es and Riches are the inheritances of our Fathers, <hi>But a prudent wife is of the Lord, Prov.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Sarah</hi> had Å¿weat at generation work, and God takes her out of the yoke to her reÅ¿t. <hi>Sarah</hi> was married to the body before Å¿he was marrried to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which taught her the better to carry her Å¿elf in that Å¿tate: For a birth, or the deÅ¿cent into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, reÅ¿embles the condition of matrimony: in both they leave their Fathers houÅ¿e, and go into a Å¿trange
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93651:14"/> land, it was Å¿o with <hi>Sarah;</hi> The females do not only leave their habitation, but their name; Å¿o in deÅ¿cent into the body; and therefore the Jewes had this Maxime amongÅ¿t them, <hi>Matris familia non est familia;</hi> they reckoned not their Pedigrees after the mother, but the father, as you may Å¿ee in ChriÅ¿t's! Thus alÅ¿o <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was married, he muÅ¿t leave his Countrey, and get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Å¿trange land from his Fathers houÅ¿e, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers kindred, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Sarah</hi> had done thus before; Å¿he had, doubtleÅ¿s, better acquaintance above, whom Å¿he left when Å¿he came to be cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with mortality and with fleÅ¿h; whom, Å¿he in the Text after her long abÅ¿ence, goes to viÅ¿ite; as the opening of the vital powers of the body was the door through which Å¿he enterred into this mortal Å¿tate; <hi>(Corporis vita, est mors animae;</hi> the life of the body, is the death of the Å¿oul) Å¿o the Å¿hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoÅ¿e vital powers of the body, is the door at which the Å¿oul goes out, and that is death.</p>
            <p>In the words then we have <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Joy, and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Å¿orrow, that is <hi>Sarah</hi>'s death, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s life: What a Å¿trange world is this, that our beÅ¿t friends Å¿hould be the occaÅ¿ion of our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t grief! a low condition of life, when our deareÅ¿t relations are grounds of our bittereÅ¿t tears; when our moÅ¿t choice mercies, put us to the moÅ¿t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiÅ¿ite pain: We may obÅ¿erve many Doctrines from them, which if I could do any more then mention, might not be without their profit; to name Å¿ome.</p>

                     </gap>. A light revealed, a light in order to a farther manifeÅ¿tation of God to the Gentles. This teÅ¿timony ChriÅ¿t gives of himÅ¿elf, who like other light cannot make a falÅ¿e repreÅ¿entation of its Å¿elf. <hi>John</hi> 12. 46. <hi>I am come a light into the world, that whoÅ¿oever believeth in me Å¿hould not abide in darkneÅ¿s.</hi> ChriÅ¿t hath all the properties of light; to this purpoÅ¿e conÅ¿ider a few particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Light was the firÅ¿t Creature in the viÅ¿ible cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that God Å¿aw any beauty in. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>God Å¿aid let there be light, and there was ligbt;</hi> till then the earth was without form and void, a Chaos,
<q>Rudis indigeÅ¿taque moles.</q> and darkneÅ¿s was upon the face of the whole earth.</p>
                  <p>Thus ChriÅ¿t is the light, in whom the Father takes complacency, and in him alÅ¿o doth he accept of men. <hi>In whom we have redemption,</hi> EpheÅ¿. 1. 7. <hi>In whom we are made acceptable,</hi> EpheÅ¿. 1. 6. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaÅ¿ed,</hi> Mat. 3. 17. He is the <hi>Benjamin</hi> whom we muÅ¿t carry with us, or we muÅ¿t not Å¿ee the Lords face; <hi>For without faith in him it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to pleaÅ¿e God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Light is good; and this appeared as Å¿oon as it was created. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>God Å¿aw the light that it was good, and God put a diÅ¿tinction between the light and between the darkneÅ¿s.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ChriÅ¿t will be acknowledged by all thoÅ¿e whom he hath redeemed from <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneÅ¿s, that he is good. You that have taÅ¿ted of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93651:117"/> I appeal to your own experiences; as for thoÅ¿e that have not taÅ¿ted, they will not believe, becauÅ¿e they Å¿ee not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Light manifeÅ¿teth it Å¿elf and other things to the eye; light diÅ¿covers it Å¿elf and other Creatures to the underÅ¿tanding. <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>But all things that are diÅ¿covered, are made manifeÅ¿t to the light; for whatÅ¿oever doth make manifeÅ¿t, is light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ChriÅ¿t he bore witneÅ¿s, or manifeÅ¿ted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf. <hi>John</hi> 8. 16, 17, 18. <hi>I judge of my Å¿elf, and my judgement is true: Is it not written in your Law, that the witneÅ¿s of two men is true?</hi> Deut. 17. 6. <hi>I am one that bear witneÅ¿s of my Å¿elf; but yet I am not alone; the Father that Å¿ent me, beareth witneÅ¿s of me alÅ¿o.</hi> Thus <hi>John</hi> 14. 21. <hi>They that keep the Commandments, love the Father; and Å¿uch ChriÅ¿t will love, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t himÅ¿elf unto.</hi> So he manifeÅ¿ts his Father glory. John 17. 6. <hi>I have manifeÅ¿ted thy name to the men which thou gaveÅ¿t me; I have declared thy name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and will declare it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Light reproves, judges, betrayes or condemns: thence falÅ¿e Teachers abide not the light, becauÅ¿e it detects them. FalÅ¿e Wares are not vendible, but in the dark; thence is it that the Workers of iniquity Å¿eek darkneÅ¿s and the Å¿hadow of death, that they may hide themÅ¿elves, <hi>Job</hi> 34. 22.</p>
                  <p>Thus ChriÅ¿t he diÅ¿covers, betrayes, judges, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, condemns; therefore a believing in ChriÅ¿t is an exemption from condemnation, and not a Believing in ChriÅ¿t is Condemnatio. See for this, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20. A very clear place, <hi>He that believeth on him, is not condemned; but he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:93651:118"/> 
                     <hi>not, is condemned already; and this is the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that Light is come into the world, and men love darknÅ¿s rather then light, becauÅ¿e their deeds are evil; for every one that doth evil, hateth the light, leÅ¿t his deeds Å¿hould be reproved; but he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeÅ¿t that they are wrought of God.</hi> Here we may Å¿ee ChriÅ¿t is the light that both manifeÅ¿teth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Light is a pleaÅ¿ant Object, and deÅ¿ireable; it draws the eye, clears the heart of all Creatures that are not blind; whither it appear in a Spark, a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, a Comet, a Star, a Worm, a Meteor, or in the Sun, it ia very pleaÅ¿ant; it is akin to the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, pleaÅ¿ant to the eye, and a thing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ired to make one wiÅ¿e: therefore the Epithite of <hi>Aurora</hi> the morning, is <hi>jucunda;</hi> the Epithite of the night, <hi>Opaca, tenebroÅ¿a, horribilis,</hi> darkneÅ¿s and horror.</p>
                  <p>Thus ChriÅ¿t, he is light, the pleaÅ¿ant morning Star, the day-Å¿pring from on high. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 7, 8. Very deÅ¿ireable; for Nations that knew not him Å¿hall run unto him. <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 55. 5. Thus when the Watchmen knew not what the SpouÅ¿es beloved was more then another beloved, Å¿he tells them that he is white and ruddy, the chief among ten thouÅ¿and; and thence is it that the promiÅ¿ed Å¿eed is called <hi>The DeÅ¿ire of all Nations. Hag.</hi> 2. 6, 7. Once more I will Å¿hake the heavens, and the earth, and the Å¿ea, and the dry land, and the deÅ¿ire of all Nations Å¿hall come, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93651:118"/> I will fill this houÅ¿e with glory, Å¿aith the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Light is Å¿uch a thing, that without it ones happineÅ¿s cannot be compleated. We look upon them as objects of pity, who cannot Å¿ee, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apprehend the light. Thus it Å¿eems to be as great an EmphaÅ¿is of the curÅ¿e for diÅ¿obedience, as any that can be expreÅ¿Å¿ed. <hi>Deut.</hi> 38. 28, 29. The Lord will Å¿mite thee with madneÅ¿s, and blindneÅ¿s, and aÅ¿toniÅ¿hment of heart; and thou Å¿halt groap at noon-day, as the blind groapeth in darkneÅ¿s; and thou Å¿halt not proÅ¿per in thy wayes, and thou Å¿halt be only oppreÅ¿Å¿ed and Å¿poiled evermore, and no man Å¿hall Å¿ave thee.</p>
                  <p>Thus ChriÅ¿t is the Light; him, without whom we muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be miÅ¿erable. May not every poor Å¿oul cry out as <hi>Abraham</hi> in deÅ¿ire of a Å¿on, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 2. Lord, what wilt thou give me, if I go childleÅ¿s! May not Å¿elf-condemning Å¿inners cry in the Å¿ame language, Lord, What will become of us, if we go ChriÅ¿tleÅ¿s! Hence it was that the ApoÅ¿tle could count all things loÅ¿s that he might gain ChriÅ¿t. He would be willing to be a fool for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us his Lord. Thus <hi>Davids</hi> Å¿oul was Å¿ore troubled, <hi>PÅ¿alm</hi> 6. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Pater,</hi> a father comes. ChriÅ¿t is as a Father, in whom alone a trembling Child can acquieÅ¿ce, can take complacency and Å¿atisfaction; Å¿o as Å¿oon as juÅ¿t <hi>Simeon</hi> had but Å¿een him, this gave him

I hope my boldneÅ¿Å¿e is pardonable; I do not take upon me peremptorily to direct thoÅ¿e reverend and holy, of whom I am not aÅ¿hamed to aske infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; yet a Å¿mall candle may diÅ¿cover the beam, as well as a torch can do the mote; as for the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and painfull in the Lords vineyard, they are not concerned: what I Å¿ay is not intended to you; and as for the impious, and prophane (for <hi>(proh dolor!)</hi> I know of both Å¿orts,) I am not concerned what they think of me; Oh that none of the veÅ¿Å¿els of the Å¿anctuary might be empty veÅ¿Å¿els, nor thoÅ¿e dry breÅ¿ts that are Å¿et, or that have undertaken to feed and fill a hungry and an empty people.</p>
                  <p>Oh how neceÅ¿Å¿ary is a capacious judgment, and how dangerous is it to ceaÅ¿e drawing untill it be full! it is more commendable to have a profound and a deep underÅ¿tanding then a gliding &amp; voluble tongue; though it be requiÅ¿ite in the Prophet to Å¿peak, yet more requiÅ¿ite to know; therefore of old the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were called Å¿eers, workers, and labourers, but never till of late dayes that I meet with were they called Speakers; nay, PropheÅ¿ie by the ApoÅ¿tle is preferred before Å¿peaking with tongues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 5. <hi>I would that you all Å¿pake with tongues, but</hi>

Which Å¿um amounted to the price that ChriÅ¿t was Å¿old for; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firÅ¿t born was in a peculiar manner given to the Lord; thus it was an unwonted thing, very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that one firÅ¿t borne Å¿hould not be chief, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 10.

                  <p n="3">3. A Leprous mans perÅ¿on was not only defiled, but whatÅ¿oever he touched was unclean. <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 22. <hi>WhatÅ¿oever the unclean perÅ¿on toucheth Å¿hall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean:</hi> Thus Å¿in defiles not only our perÅ¿on, but there is a defilement goeth along with all our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances and duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all our abomination.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Such was the defilement of the LeproÅ¿ie, that the Leper was excluded from the Congregation. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Command the Children of IÅ¿rael that they put out of the Camp every Leper, and every one that hath an iÅ¿Å¿ue, and whoÅ¿oever is defiled by the dead:</hi> Thus Å¿in, that deep LeproÅ¿ie, excludes either out of the Congregation, or out of heaven, or out of both. Oh, it is dangerous to admit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane to the participation of holy things! they are to be pronounced as againÅ¿t <hi>unclean,</hi> Lev. 13. 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. ConÅ¿ider the nature of the clenÅ¿ing. 1. It was to be done by the touch of the <hi>high PrieÅ¿t:</hi> it was the PrieÅ¿t only that could pronounce <hi>clean,</hi> Levit. 13, 13. 37, 59. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 48. <hi>Both houÅ¿e and perÅ¿on muÅ¿t be clenÅ¿ed by the PrieÅ¿t.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t be he that clenÅ¿eth Å¿inners: there is no name under heaven given, by which we can be Å¿aved, but by the name of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. 2. It was not ordinary that the Leprous were healed of their Å¿ores, but thoÅ¿e abode as long as they lived; therefore when ChriÅ¿t did not only clenÅ¿e the Leper but heal him, the Jews looked upon it as a Miracle, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 13. <hi>There was not only a making clean, but</hi>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:93651:136"/> 
                     <hi>a making whole;</hi> Å¿ee it expreÅ¿ly Å¿et down. <hi>The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proÅ¿ie departed from them whom ChriÅ¿t clenÅ¿ed;</hi> but not Å¿o with thoÅ¿e that the <hi>High PrieÅ¿t</hi> of the Jewes clenÅ¿ed. 3. NotwithÅ¿tanding the Å¿cars and Å¿ores remained; yet after the <hi>High PrieÅ¿t</hi> had pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them clean, they were all admitted again into the Congregation. Thus <hi>Gehazi</hi> was condemned to a perpetual leproÅ¿ie, a leproÅ¿ie for ever; yet we find that after this denouncing the leproÅ¿ie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneÅ¿s upon him, he had converÅ¿e with the King. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 4. 5. <hi>When he was pronounced clean, then he might come into the Congregation, though he was never healed from his Å¿ores.</hi> Thus ChriÅ¿t may by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tification pronounce, That the guilt Å¿hall not be imputed, though the filth be not wholly taken away by Å¿anctification as long as a man liveth. 3. ConÅ¿ider the qualification of the perÅ¿ons that were to be clenÅ¿ed, and that was, they Å¿hould be all over Å¿ores, wholy defiled, &amp; then Å¿hould they be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>clean. Lev.</hi> 13. 12, 13. <hi>And if a LeproÅ¿ie break out abroad in the skin, and cover all the skin of him that hath the plague, from the head even to the foot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever the PrieÅ¿t looketh, then the PrieÅ¿t Å¿hall conÅ¿ider, and behold, if the LeproÅ¿ie have covered all his fleÅ¿h, he Å¿hall pronounce him clean that hath the plague; it is turned white, he is clean.</hi> A Å¿trange Law, then to be pronounced clean, when the defilement hath wholy overÅ¿pread the fleÅ¿h.</p>
                  <p>Thus ChriÅ¿t, thoÅ¿e whom he leaves, muÅ¿t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg their caÅ¿e deÅ¿perate; thoÅ¿e whom he heals, muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s themÅ¿elves to be very Å¿ick; the Å¿inner muÅ¿t acknowledge himÅ¿elf Å¿inful, before he look after a Saviour, or before ChriÅ¿t will come down to Å¿ave him.</p>

                     <p>1. The guilt of Å¿in. 2. The filth or Å¿tain. 3. The power and dominion. 4. The Å¿ad and undoing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equences of Å¿in: all which ChriÅ¿t the High PrieÅ¿t takes away in believers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The guilt of Å¿in is taken away by ChriÅ¿t, which doth comprehend theÅ¿e things in it, which I Å¿hall Å¿peak to in particular.</p>
                     <p>1. Imputation. 2. Debt. 3. ObnoxiouÅ¿neÅ¿s. 4. Mortality; which four things when I have Å¿hewn that ChriÅ¿t takes away, there will remain nothing in the nature of guilt, but it will be removed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 To the making up of guilt, there is required imputation; and untill this, there can be no Å¿enÅ¿e of the guilt of Å¿in, untill Å¿in be laid to the charge of the Å¿oul; and untill the Å¿pirit convinces us, and makes conÅ¿cience point at us, and Å¿ay, we are the men, and women, there wiil be no Å¿enÅ¿e of Å¿in; the Å¿oul is not apprehenÅ¿ive of offending, untill the offence be imputed, and particularly applyed. Thus we find as Å¿oon as the Å¿enÅ¿e of <hi>Sauls</hi> carriage was charged home upon his conÅ¿cience, and he found a witneÅ¿s in himÅ¿elf, telling him that <hi>David</hi> had not done Å¿o with him, then he lift up his voice, and wept, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17. 18. Thus when the Å¿inner can
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93651:138"/> Å¿ay, <hi>Lord, I am the man, I am the Traitor, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> then guilt begins to appear, and that is terrible; this voice when it imputes Å¿in, it makes the Å¿tout heart to tremble, as the Law did, and the thunders and lightnings that were heard then; <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 16. For I may Å¿ay by this is the knowledge of Å¿in, as well as by the Law; Å¿o we find as Å¿oon as the Å¿enÅ¿e of Å¿in was imputed to the Jaylor in his own breaÅ¿t, then he called for a light, and Å¿prang in, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and fell down before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas; Oh then men and brethren what muÅ¿t we do to be Å¿aved! Acts</hi> 16. 29. This is the firÅ¿t thing that is implyed in guilt, an imputation of the offence, or an applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to the Å¿oul.</p>
                     <p>Now ChriÅ¿t the high PrieÅ¿t he takes away this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Å¿in, by taking the fault to himÅ¿elf, and Å¿o laying our iniquities on his own Å¿houlders, and bearing our tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions in his own perÅ¿on; he diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges the Å¿oul of it, and takes their accounts on his Å¿core, and Å¿ayes, <hi>Let your Å¿ins be at my peril:</hi> and thus he is <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93651:139"/> Å¿in is not imputed to us, but to another. And this ChriÅ¿t takes upon him; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28.

Thus it is clear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 21. <hi>All things are of God who hath reconciled us to himÅ¿elf by JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and hath given to us the MiniÅ¿try of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in ChriÅ¿t reconciling the world to himÅ¿elf, not imputing their treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es to them: for he hath made him to be Å¿in for us, who knew no Å¿in, that we might be made the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of God in him.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. In Guilt, or to the eÅ¿Å¿ence of guilt there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired debt, and this follows upon imputation; for untill imputation, debt is not acknowledged; till debt be acknowledged, the Å¿inner juÅ¿tifies himÅ¿elf, and thinks that he is clear from the blood of every man, and no man can lay a farthing to his charge; Å¿o that he is like the PhariÅ¿ee, no debtor to the Law, but he hath done all things contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, paid every man his own, faÅ¿ted twice a week, is no Extortioner, no Murderer, <hi>&amp;c.

But you may Å¿ee in the Publican, as Å¿oon as he had imputed his Å¿in to him, he doth not Å¿tand to juÅ¿tifie himÅ¿elf, but to plead a Debtor, and beg mercy; he durÅ¿t not Å¿o much as lift up his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but Å¿mote upon his breaÅ¿t, and Å¿aid, <hi>Lord be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to me a Å¿inner:</hi> therefore in that implicite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion in the Lords Prayer, ChriÅ¿t when he teacheth us to ask forgiveneÅ¿s, he at the Å¿ame time teaches us to call Å¿ins debts; knowing that none can really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire to be forgiven, where they think they owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 22. <hi>And forgivt us our debts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

This therefore was called Grace, as indeed it was; for he paid our debts, though he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no previous obligation to us; nay, though ChriÅ¿t knew our poverty, and that we were never able to pay the Å¿core of Å¿in, or to repay him, Å¿hould he lay down his life for us: and though he knew, in caÅ¿e of our inÅ¿ufficiency, the price would be required of him who was become our Surety; yet he would bind himÅ¿elf on our behalfes; Oh this was free grace, to undertake to pay our debts for us, when he was in no debt to us: therefore the ApoÅ¿tle magnifies Grace, which bound ChriÅ¿t on our behalfes, when we were Å¿trangers, nay, enemies to him by wicked works. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is conÅ¿iderable in guilt, ObnoxiouÅ¿neÅ¿s, which follows upon the imputation of the debt: for as Å¿oon as debt is laid to the charge of the Å¿oul, and imputed to it, Oh then there is an ingenuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion of guiltineÅ¿s, which carryes with it the Å¿ence of the breach of the Law, and obnoxiouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e to the Law, or a being liable to the penalty of the Law; and then the Å¿inner Å¿ees himÅ¿elf under threatnings, curÅ¿es, condemnation: and if he be not Å¿tupified then under the Å¿enÅ¿e of his obnoxiouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, muÅ¿t ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther openly reÅ¿iÅ¿t, and bid defiance to the Lotd of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93651:140"/> hoÅ¿ts, or elÅ¿e he muÅ¿t fall down, and cry for mercy, &amp; pardon for the Lords ChriÅ¿ts Å¿ake. WhilÅ¿t a hard heart can evade debt and imputation, he will; but when Å¿in is laid to his charge, then he becomes a Debtor, and obnoxious, agreeable to the evidence in his own conÅ¿cience; and when this is demonÅ¿trated to his face, then he muÅ¿t either did defiance to God, or fall down, and implore his grace: thus the brethren of <hi>JoÅ¿eph</hi> evaded, being obnoxious as long as they could; but when he came with evidence upon them, and told them, that he could certainly divine, then they Å¿tood out no more, but cryed, <hi>What Å¿hall we Å¿ay to my Lord, what Å¿hall we Å¿peak, or how Å¿hall we clear our Å¿elves? God hath found out the iniquity of his Å¿ervants; behold we are my Lords Å¿ervants, both we, and he alÅ¿o with whom the cup is found,</hi> Gen. 44. 15, 16.</p>
                     <p>Now ChriÅ¿t our High PrieÅ¿t takes away obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿s, <hi>PerÅ¿onam Å¿uam noÅ¿tro loco offerendo,</hi> by putting his perÅ¿on into our place: for the Law would not be Å¿atisfied without blood, for without blood there is no remiÅ¿Å¿ion; and God having us under engagement, (to Å¿peak after the manner of men) Å¿ues his bond; and being we were unable, the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is found liable to the Å¿ame debt: and thus the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity fell upon him, who knew no Å¿in, becauÅ¿e he was engaged with us; here was grace, free grace; and it appeared the more, in as much as the Å¿trait was greater into which poor Å¿ouls were brought: thus ChriÅ¿t interpoÅ¿ed as high PrieÅ¿t, and not only Å¿o, but as a Å¿acrifice; the clean fot the unclean, the juÅ¿t for the unjuÅ¿t, the righteous for the Å¿inner, the Creator for the Creature, CÅ¿triÅ¿t for man, nay for

                     <p>Now this ChriÅ¿t our high PrieÅ¿t takes away by working us to a conformity by degrees, and Å¿et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up another Law in the mind that reÅ¿iÅ¿teth the Law in the members: for as <hi>Nemo repente fit tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿Å¿imus,</hi> no man is deÅ¿perately wicked at the firÅ¿t motion; Å¿o no man gets to the top of piety at the firÅ¿t Å¿tep, but by degrees. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21, 22. When the ApoÅ¿tle had complained of his body of death, he preÅ¿ently thanks God through ChriÅ¿t, as taking away that proneÅ¿s and propenÅ¿ity in the fleÅ¿h by the minds conqueÅ¿t over it.

I dare not poÅ¿itively affirm, that Å¿he walked in this or that way, becauÅ¿e it is of a GoÅ¿pel Track, except I my Å¿elf had been a Spectator: but this liberty I may take, to think that Å¿he Å¿eldom miÅ¿Å¿ed her way, becauÅ¿e Å¿he was Å¿o skilled in holy walking. I know there is a PhyÅ¿ical PoÅ¿sibility, that I may Å¿peake the Å¿ame things of the moÅ¿t undeÅ¿erving perÅ¿on in the world, <hi>mutato tantum nomine,</hi> only exchanging the name; but moral neceÅ¿Å¿ity interdicts me.

How oft hath Å¿he been in a dry and thirÅ¿ty land, and yet fainted not! How bitter her cup hath been made, and yet Å¿he would drink it with praiÅ¿es!

A Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans converÅ¿ation under a Clergy-mans apparrel, profaneÅ¿s under a gown, was an unÅ¿eemly Å¿ight to her; worldly Å¿tuff is not to be treaÅ¿ured up in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters hearts; Å¿he would Å¿ay, that it made many think more undervaluingly of heaven, when thoÅ¿e that went to Å¿pie out the land, had their hearts Å¿o much on earth.

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:93651:189"/> would expect their hearts Å¿hould alÅ¿o be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed that came to live under her roof: Her Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who frequented her preÅ¿ence, were to have their bodies free from dirt, and their Å¿ouls waÅ¿hed from all filthineÅ¿s of fleÅ¿h and Å¿pirit, or elÅ¿e they were not entertained: this I was fully convinced of, that no quality in her Å¿ervant, gained Å¿o much reÅ¿pect and love from her, as grace in the heart; though Å¿ometime Å¿he hath weighed the little Å¿ervice which Å¿he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from Å¿ome, yet that would not move her to part with them, but Å¿he would keep them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e gracious: and when Å¿he hath been told of the inÅ¿ufficiency of Å¿ome, Å¿he would make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer, <hi>But they are honeÅ¿t.</hi> She conÅ¿idered, that thoÅ¿e who were gracious, had a bleÅ¿Å¿ing attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, though they could do little: and though they could not work much, yet if they prayed, the work would be well done, though but little. She would often Å¿ay, how can any Å¿erve me faithfully, and perform their duty as they ought, when they make no conÅ¿cience of Å¿erving God? at the beÅ¿t they will but be <gap reason="foreign">

How fair a Copy, and how true letters did many write after her! I durÅ¿t Å¿peak it with boldneÅ¿s, (were it proper for me that am a member of the family my Å¿elf to Å¿ay Å¿o) that in her houÅ¿e Å¿he had proportionally as many Å¿ervants, who Å¿et
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:93651:190"/> their faces towards Sion, and loved the Lord JeÅ¿us in Å¿incerity and in truth, as was in any noble family in the land! How rare was it to hear a profane word, or Å¿ee a profane geÅ¿ture! From the time of my coming to dwell with her LadyÅ¿hip, untill her death, I cannot Å¿ay that ever I heard an oath, neither Å¿ee man drunk in the houÅ¿e, Å¿ave one. It was an houÅ¿e where grace was Å¿miled upon, and where Å¿in lay under a reproach. Oh what Å¿triving was there which Å¿hould get to heaven firÅ¿t, which did much improve both our graces and our duties! the wayes of God were not there evil Å¿poken of; if her LadyÅ¿hip had known it, Å¿he would have Å¿oon Å¿topped their mouths. She manured the Å¿oil with GoÅ¿pel inÅ¿tructions; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e Å¿he generally entertained an able Divine in her houÅ¿e; though I cannot Å¿ay Å¿o by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience Å¿ince I dwelt with her; neither would I, thought I might; yet for the moÅ¿t part Å¿he endeavoured to have both the learned and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, whom Å¿he did not keep to be idle; neither did Å¿he imploy them without abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly rewarding them. She alwayes thought a MiniÅ¿ter in her houÅ¿e, though coÅ¿tly, yet to be great riches; and would Å¿ay, maintaining a godly Chaplain, makes no man poor. Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s was promoted Å¿o by her encouragement, and by the Chaplains induÅ¿try, that it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in the Å¿ervants to be ambitious which Å¿hould be beÅ¿t, not which Å¿hould be greateÅ¿t. She was exact in keeping a due order, that her
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:93651:190"/> family might know when to Å¿erve her, and when to Å¿erve God. As Å¿he diÅ¿cerned any noxious weeds to grow up, Å¿he would Å¿o influence them with her frowns, that their natures were often changed; but if that would not do, Å¿he would root them out. The weeds that Å¿he would labour to pull out, were Å¿uch as were either uÅ¿eleÅ¿s or infectious, or both: though Å¿he could not eradicate Å¿in where it was out of her reach, yet Å¿he would diÅ¿quiet it where Å¿he had any thing to do; a little to Å¿hew what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications her Å¿ervants were to have, and what Å¿ins Å¿he diÅ¿eÅ¿teemed in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. She entertained no prophane; alwayes fearing, that they like pitch or a leproÅ¿ie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file all they touch, or blaÅ¿t all they go about to do: She as much feared to entertain a man or woman dead in treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es or Å¿in, as the <hi>Jews</hi> feared to touch a dead body, becauÅ¿e of their uncleanneÅ¿s: and though I cannot tell how Å¿he would have carried to Å¿uch in her own family, (for there was none that durÅ¿t be Å¿o, and Å¿o known to her) yet by her diÅ¿like of that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ight and indulgence in others, Å¿he Å¿hewed that a prophane man Å¿hould not have gone without his reward: it is true, to be deboiÅ¿t, is a merry life, if there were to be no account hereafter, when we come to dye: or if the moÅ¿t AtheiÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Å¿hould be the moÅ¿t deifyed hereafter, it would be the beÅ¿t work to do nothing at all: and the only time would be to redeem no time;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:93651:191"/> but there is a dreadfull Å¿entence, <hi>Go ye curÅ¿ed;</hi> and that will need no EmphaÅ¿is; it is heavy enough in this, to be Å¿eparated from God: whom to enjoy is life eternal.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. She laboured, as that hers Å¿hould not be wholy blinded by profaneÅ¿s; Å¿o that they Å¿hould not be hood-winked with ignorance; knowing it is as eaÅ¿ie for Satan to cauÅ¿e an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Å¿oul to worÅ¿hip a Å¿tone, and idolize a word, as it was for the boy that lead venerable <hi>Beda,</hi> to make him preach to a heap of Å¿tones, telling him, that they were men.

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:93651:191"/> Å¿tones, or Å¿plitting upon rocks, and making Å¿hipwrack of faith.

And indeed that Å¿in Å¿eems to be Å¿trangely unnatural, becauÅ¿e it takes away for the preÅ¿ent, that whereby man is diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from bruit beaÅ¿ts; to wit, the more lively exerciÅ¿e of his rational faculties. It would trouble her to Å¿ee it in others, (though Å¿he prevented it in her own) that lived like <hi>BonoÅ¿us,</hi> as though they were born <hi>ut biberent, non ut viverent:</hi> of whom is was Å¿aid, and that according to his deÅ¿ert, when he had hanged himÅ¿elf, <hi>There hangs a Tankard, not a man.</hi> I have read, when <hi>AeÅ¿chines</hi> in a diÅ¿courÅ¿e with <hi>DemoÅ¿thenes,</hi> was commending <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> for a brave man, who would drink much: <hi>DemoÅ¿thenes</hi> replyes, that, that was a good quality in a Å¿punge, but not in a man: This is the door at which many other
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:93651:192"/> evils enter. How often would Å¿he Å¿ay, to that effect, with <hi>Bernard, Ad univerÅ¿a, vel crudeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, vel turpitudinis facinora perpetranda faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis invenitur via, cui nulla Å¿obria ment is ratio, Å¿ed ebrietas dominatur:</hi> How Å¿oon is the courÅ¿e of nature inflamed, and all on a fire, when there is moÅ¿t drink in the brain!</p>

               <p>And as Å¿he hated this Å¿in in all, Å¿o eÅ¿pecially in MiniÅ¿ters: a Drunken Clergy man was like great wits Å¿et upon wrong Objects, moÅ¿t pernitious: The <hi>Monks,</hi> that abÅ¿temous generation, call the beÅ¿t wine, <hi>Vinum Theologicum,</hi> Divine wine, and beÅ¿t befitting themÅ¿elves to drink; but in them this Å¿in would be <hi>peccatum diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> Å¿enÅ¿ual deviliÅ¿h: when corrupted, it makes the tarteÅ¿t vinegar; Å¿o the corrupted Clergy make the moÅ¿t prophane.</p>
