         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is uſual for thoſe that appear in publick, to prefix ſome great name before them, that they may gain the greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, and that the army of their words may be looked on to be more conſiderable, when they have ſo valiant a forlorn: It is no more then needs
<pb facs="tcp:93651:3"/> that ſome Coats have ſupporters, eſpecially when there are notes of abatement in the charge; Amongſt whom I rank my ſelf, who had I not had a copious ſubject, ſhould have deſired invention; who now only deſire that my labour may find protection under your wing; and the more confident I am, that I ſhall not be fruſtrated, when I conſider who it is that is here preſented to your Lordſhips view.</p>
            <p>I confeſs a fair front may be ſet before a mean Cottage by an unskilfull Builder; and I may rank your honourable Name as a Patron to that, which for its own merits ſake is not worth your Lordſhips reading, much leſs your protection: But I ſhall not ſo much deſire that the faſhion of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument be obſerved by you, as the materials whereon it is built; and then I promiſe my ſelf this, that though you ſhould not like the frame of the building, yet you would not have the Timber loſt. What I ſaw in her Ladiſhip (whom I here preſent to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) uſefull for ſuch a work as this, I pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mine own obſervation. Another that could have built this Monument in more ſtate, might have found hewn ſtones fitted to his hand; though thoſe, which for their
<pb facs="tcp:93651:3"/> curious workmanſhip, I knew not how to place right, are lefr out, not becauſe I ſee them not, but becauſe I could not place them to their worth. And having built this ſmall Pile of her vertues, not knowing to whom ſhe more of right belonged then to your ſelf, I have made bold to give it your Lordſhips Superſcription.</p>
            <p>You may ſay to me in this attempt, as <hi>Aeneas</hi> did to <hi>Dido,</hi> when ſhe deſired a Narration of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Wars,
<q>Infandum—jubes renovare dolorem;</q> That I bring you again to the houſe of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and open the ſluces of thoſe eyes that were almoſt ſhut; and for this cauſe (did I not hope that the profit you may receive, will countervail the ſorrow which you will find in the renewing of her remembrance) I ſhould have been ſilent: but if the ſtreams of your teares waſh your ſoul, and your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for her terminate in ſorrow for ſin, I ſhall not think my labour either prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or in vain: if the flood turn inward, I am willing to clenſe and open, rather then to ſtop or interrupt the free paſſage.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had ſhewn the <hi>Perſian</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93651:4"/> King the glory of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ſtately Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of deceaſed Emperors, he looked on them, and ſaid, <hi>Mira quidem haec, ſed ut video, ſicut in</hi> Perſia, <hi>ſic</hi> Romae, <hi>homines mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuntur;</hi> though you have men of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, yet I ſee as we do in <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſo at <hi>Rome</hi> all dye. I hope your Lordſhip judged ſo of her; that though ſhe was pure, yet ſhe was brittle; though precious, yet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. The Oak in time will decay as well as the Willow; and the ſtrongeſt tower, though a ſtorm will not, yet a thunderclap will ſhatter it to pieces: <hi>Fragilem frangi, &amp; mortalem mori,</hi> to ſee a glaſs break, or a Candle burn to the ſnuff, is no new thing.</p>
            <p>It is a mortifying conſideration to look over a dead wife, or a dead child; but we who have corruption ſo apt to live, had need ſometimes be told that our frame is ſubject to dye: this conſideration will ſtill home-bred Wars, namely, to be told of an invaſion; the fleſh will ſooner be mortified, and the ſpirit will endeavour to be ſupreme the rather, when it conſiders that it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that when he came to <hi>Achilles</hi> his Tomb, he wept, becauſe he had not a <hi>Homer</hi> to ſet him forth. For
<pb facs="tcp:93651:4"/> this purpoſe it is reported, that <hi>Alphonſus</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> King of <hi>Cicily,</hi> kept <hi>Panormitan</hi> the Poet, that he might immortalize his name; and though that cannot be expected from me, what another might have writ, who had known her longer; yet ſomething I have obſerved according to my knowledge; nay, I have ſeen more in her then I know how to expreſs here: For he had need be a neat Limner that draws a beauty to the life; and he had need underſtand the tongue, that attempts to expreſs her language, and ſtands need to have trod in her ſteps too, that goeth about to deſcribe them.</p>
            <p>When I conſidered the remarkableneſs of the providence, the noiſe that it made, and how loud it ſpoke to us all, I thought, God would not have it forgot: and when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that in ſo ſhort a time, the memory of that great ſtroke was ſomething more dark, and ready to wear out, I undertook this work, which I formerly did not intend; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to build a Monument, whereby <note n="*" place="margin">The mother and the ſon both dying in a fort-nights ſpace.</note> their names, whoſe perſons the Lord hath taken to himſelf, ſhould not be forgotten; and it is becauſe we have almoſt forgot to read my <hi>Ladies ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93651:5"/> that I put them in print; had our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories been better to have retained more, I ſhould have ſpoken leſs, if any thing at all.</p>
            <p>It ſeems God ſaw that we had need of ſuch a great affliction, or elſe he would not have doubled it; and if the ſmart of it do not make impreſſion, he can plat another cord, and be more ſevere: Oh therefore that what we have felt, might make us ſay, <hi>Spare Lord, and we will do ſo no more.</hi> Could we but find the pleaſures of ſin to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the torment for ſin, we might be leſs cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious: and if it were ſo, that brethren in iniquity who have drawn us to ſin, could get as much favour hereafter as they get us affliction and ſorrow here, we need not be much circumſpect: but to conſider that our very companions, nay, our very Tempters will be our accuſers; and he, for whoſe ſake we became tranſgreſſors, will betray us: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is more rational to truſt God in a way of holineſs, who will never forſake us, then man in a way of ſin who will not aſſiſt us in time of danger.</p>
            <p>I have ground to believe, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had not eſpouſed her perſon only, but her graces; and did not love her only for external accompliſhments, but for her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:93651:5"/> zeal. What I here publiſh, is no more then you knew, no more then you approved of: I wiſh none that are religious, were more unequally yoked. I have ſeen ſome husbands <hi>canes in praeſepibus,</hi> or like the Scribes and Phareſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 13. who ſhut the Kingdom of heaven, &amp; will neither enter in themſelves, nor ſuffer them that are entring to go in: had it been ſo with her, ſhe had not been ſo forward: ſhe hath often reckoned it a mercy which ſhe received from your Lordſhip, as well as from her heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that you did not offer to quench, but kindled the fire of her zeal; that you did not pull off the Chariot wheels, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oil them; that you did not conſtrain her to tread in thoſe ſteps which were not ſuitable to her ſpeed, nor force her to wear that ſhoe which did not ſit eaſie on her foot: conſidering that it is uncomfortable for one in a race to be clogged with any burdens but neceſſaries. I deſire the Lord Almighty to bleſs you with the ſame bleſſing; that as they have fixed their reſolution for heaven, they may not be pul'd back by thoſe that draw in the ſame yoke with them; and that they may never be conſtrained to ſpeak in a language they underſtand not;
<pb facs="tcp:93651:6"/> though there are many voices, yet none of them is without ſignification; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 10. They in this ſenſe have been uſed to ſpeak in their mothers tongue; and though it ſhould ſeem barbarous to others, yet to ſpeak in an unknown language, would make them Barbarians to themſelves. I hope the Lord who hath made you a father, hath given you a fathers heart that is tender; not only to encourage their graces, but to bear with their infirmities. And I hope, and have te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies to convince me, that ſeeing the Lord hath bleſſed you with ſuch Children, you will not be unwilling that they ſhould beſtow themſelves on the Lord.</p>
            <p>As to my ſelf and preſent work, it is my firſt fruits, which had not been ripe yet, but that it was ſo ſoon Autumn with her; and becauſe it grows in your Lordſhips ſoil, I cannot but dedicate it to your ſelf; wherein I do not deſire to be <hi>Theologus gloriae,</hi> but <hi>Crucis:</hi> As I dare not be found ſinning, ſo I would not be found idle when my Saviour comes. Perhaps ſome who loved her not, will cenſure me for what I have ſaid; and thoſe that deſired her vvorth ſhould be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, vvill be angry becauſe I have put it in print; yet this is my comfort, <hi>Non ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nota</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93651:6"/> 
               <hi>cano; innumeros prompſit Britannia teſtes:</hi> her light was not laid under a buſhel; thoſe that did not ſhut their eyes, might have ſeen as much as I have ſpoken; theſe who knew her would have believed themſelves, though I had not ſpoken: and thoſe that did not know her, I could deſire them to believe me, except they would have me to diſtruſt them, when they ſpeak truth. And if I be cenſured, it is no more then I would freely undergo, rather then her dear name ſhould be forgot. Thoſe that will ſpeak evil, perhaps may have ſome come after them, that will do as much for them. <hi>Valla</hi> condemned all that writ before him; (which could not be wiſdome, except he had been ſure to have been the laſt that had come upon the ſtage) <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus</hi> comes after, &amp; doth as much for him.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe hath ſwelled to a greater big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then I intended at firſt it ſhould; therefore I hope it will nouriſh the more, if digeſted: And as to ſerve you or yours, is the earneſt breathing of my deſire; ſo to perpetuate the Memory of thoſe that are deceaſed, was my greateſt aim. I confeſs there is nothing but my unſerviceableneſs that doth diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me with my condition: Could I be more uſefull, I ſhould never be willing to depart;
<pb facs="tcp:93651:7"/> If either you or yours have any errand to ſend me on, whereby I may teſtifie my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al dutifulneſs to your family, I ſhould bluſh, and take it as a diſgrace, if any man on earth ſhould either be more willing, or venture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome then my ſelf: if opportunity would permit, I hope I ſhould make it appear, that I could do more then your honour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of me: what I have done here in teſtimony how I deſire to be imployed when either the comfort or honour of them, or yours ſtands need of me, I have made bold to ſign with your Lordſhips name, that that may be to this ſmall Tractate, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of a gift, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 16. Namely, <hi>to make room, and to find entertainment for it;</hi> For I conclude, that thoſe who would not look upon it for the Authors ſake, they will for the ſubjects ſake, or at leaſt for the Patrons. I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſilver nor gold, as you want neither, but ſuch as I have I give it you, as being under greater obligations to your ſelf then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, making mention of you in my prayers, that God who hath intereſted you in the hearts and affections of men, he would alſo intereſt you in the heart and affections of his Son; and he who hath made you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable on earth, would alſo crown you with
<pb facs="tcp:93651:7"/> glory in heaven; for whoſe ſake I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling even to ſacrifice my deareſt comforts, if it would ranſome you from perils, or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the leaſt to your ſouls ſalvation; who can but now ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

               <l>They melt her heart, and ſo ſhe dropt to reſt.</l>
               <l>So dyed the Phoenix of this Land; yet ſhe</l>
               <l>As th' Phoenix doth, hath left her pedigree.</l>
               <l>The Phoenix leaves but one to be her Heir,</l>

               <l>Let after-generations for her weep:</l>
               <l>And when their ſprings and fountains are wept dry,</l>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR heavenly Father in his great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, many times keeps his deareſt Children ſhort in this world: they have famine as well as plenty; tears as well as joy. Cold and Nakedneſs to drive them home to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe. Prodigal ſons miſs of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93651:13"/> or elſe they would take up lodging with the ſwine; Beggars muſt hunger ſometimes, or elſe they will not ask; nay, they muſt be denied, or elſe they will not be importunate. Thus our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father laſheth his children where he would have them obey, and cauſeth the Sun to ſet, and darkneſs to overtake them, when he would have them return home: Indeed, the Pinacle of honour in the world is ſuch a ſlippery place, that when Satan had ſet Chriſt there, he thought he could caſt him down with more eaſe, and make his fall the greater; and when he had let him ſee the kingdomes of the earth, he thought he could more eaſily keep hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of his ſight; when he had given him to know the world, he thought by that means he could ſooneſt cauſe him to forget himſelf; and when he had mounted him ſo high, he thought it the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to make him overlook his own happineſs. Now if Satan durſt attempt to aſſault the Lord, he is not without ſtrong hopes of conquering the Servant; therefore leſt we ſhould be oblivious of our frame and nature, our Father gives us a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum;</hi> and that we may know our ſelves, he lets us ſee our faces in a glaſs.</p>
            <p>Every image of death is but a repreſentation of our own perſons, and tells us who we are. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſets out man ſo much to the life, as the grim viſage of death. Paleneſs is the colour wherein man is beſt limned. <hi>Calvin</hi> calls Saints Lives, <hi>quaſi ſpecula, condimenta,</hi> Glaſſes wherein Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may ſee their conſtitutions: the odor that would give a fragrancy to every action. I may call the Saints death <hi>Glaſſes</hi> too, wherein we may ſee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93651:13"/> our diſſolution: And indeed if a Saint be but looked through we may ſee from the womb to the grave, from thence to heaven; not not only the mark, but the way is characterized in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual mans life; not only the good beginning, but the happy end in a ſpiritual mans death. As the informations we have by Saints lives are uſefull, ſo the admonitions we have by their death are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. I do not know any that ever lived, but had need be told ſometimes that he muſt <hi>dye:</hi> never was there any that became familiar with the fleſh, but ſhould be told he muſt leave his companion: and there was never any ſo unanimouſly joyned together, but it was needfull that ſometime he ſhould hear of their putting aſunder; for which purpoſe theſe words are very uſefull, for they are the unyoking of an honourable pair, the looſing the marriage bonds of the Parents of the faithfull, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you may ſee, though no man may, yet God may put aſunder, what he himſelf hath joyned together. <hi>Abraham</hi> took him a wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 29. and here God takes her from him, and the more juſtly, becauſe ſhe was his gift. True, Houſes and Riches are the inheritances of our Fathers, <hi>But a prudent wife is of the Lord, Prov.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Sarah</hi> had ſweat at generation work, and God takes her out of the yoke to her reſt. <hi>Sarah</hi> was married to the body before ſhe was marrried to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which taught her the better to carry her ſelf in that ſtate: For a birth, or the deſcent into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, reſembles the condition of matrimony: in both they leave their Fathers houſe, and go into a ſtrange
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93651:14"/> land, it was ſo with <hi>Sarah;</hi> The females do not only leave their habitation, but their name; ſo in deſcent into the body; and therefore the Jewes had this Maxime amongſt them, <hi>Matris familia non est familia;</hi> they reckoned not their Pedigrees after the mother, but the father, as you may ſee in Chriſt's! Thus alſo <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was married, he muſt leave his Countrey, and get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtrange land from his Fathers houſe, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers kindred, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Sarah</hi> had done thus before; ſhe had, doubtleſs, better acquaintance above, whom ſhe left when ſhe came to be cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with mortality and with fleſh; whom, ſhe in the Text after her long abſence, goes to viſite; as the opening of the vital powers of the body was the door through which ſhe enterred into this mortal ſtate; <hi>(Corporis vita, est mors animae;</hi> the life of the body, is the death of the ſoul) ſo the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe vital powers of the body, is the door at which the ſoul goes out, and that is death.</p>
            <p>In the words then we have <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Joy, and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſorrow, that is <hi>Sarah</hi>'s death, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s life: What a ſtrange world is this, that our beſt friends ſhould be the occaſion of our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt grief! a low condition of life, when our deareſt relations are grounds of our bittereſt tears; when our moſt choice mercies, put us to the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite pain: We may obſerve many Doctrines from them, which if I could do any more then mention, might not be without their profit; to name ſome.</p>

Well, Chriſtians, you have goodly crops on the earth, but they muſt be reaped; ye have a fruitfull vine, but the foules of the aire will either pick the grapes, or they will fall when ripe; thou haſt a foundation laid, perhaps it is on the ſand, the ſea will waſh it; on a rock, the thunder may batter it; on wood, hay, ſtubble, fire may conſume it; is thy body well liking; hunger or ſurfet may change thy image.

As to the other of their revelations or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, it was their <hi>Ruach Haccodeſh,</hi> the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or breathing of the holy Ghoſt, which was alway had in the Temple; and that too when it was in its purity, before they had blinded their eyes with Idolatry and Hereſie: for after that they had contracted the <hi>Babyloniſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Cuſtomes, and their Idolatry, and had began to worſhip God in an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh way, more out of cuſtome, then out of filial fear, they had this revelation no more, which was very common in their purer times; ſo then you may ſee when Chriſt comes, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 2. to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether they had teceived the holy Ghoſt; they anſwer, they have not heard whether there was a holy Ghoſt or no. Here you may ſee, when they could not go up to the Temple out of their Countrey, the place where they dwelt; and when they had drowned and immerſt themſelves in Ethni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm and Impurity, they had not that ſight of God which otherwiſe they might have had. Thus it is with us, (for thoſe paſſages are ſignes and types of our viſion in the future world) thus if we would ſee as we are ſeen, know as we are known (which are priviledges for the Children of God) then we muſt be out of the fleſh, our own Tabernacle, and carried into the Temple not made with hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the heavens: Indeed were not Gods deareſt ones deſigned to have a ſight of himſelf, and to dwell in inacceſſible light, rhen they might ſtay in the body, they might ſtill dwell in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> but they muſt view the promiſed land, the Tabernacles of the Lord of Hoſts, the Cluſters of

Valleys are full of Miſts, but when we get to the mountains, we ſhall ſee clearly; and this is a reaſon who God takes his own out of the ſtate of life, becauſe he may ſhew them himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The beſt of Gods Children, as they are for viſion, ſo they are for fruition, and therefore they muſt depart from the body. Real enjoyments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire real preſence: none can actually embrace an abſent Chriſt; 'tis true; Faith doth reallize future joy, but it is but in part: and as we may ſay of the two Covenants, Chriſt took away the firſt, that he might eſtabliſh the ſecond; ſo here God will take away faith, when the ſoul comes into preſence: when fruition comes, faith ſhall vaniſh as the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before the Sun. Now indeed there is need of hope, but hope ſhall be changed into poſſeſſion, and then hope ſhall vaniſh. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24. <hi>For we are ſaved by hope;</hi> but hope that is ſeen, is not hope; for what a man ſeeth, why doth he hope for? ſo we may ſee, when this is the purpoſe of the father to eſtabliſh us on Thrones, and give us the inheritance of ſons, we muſt lay aſide faith and hope. Now ſeeing it is for the bodies ſake that we have need of faith; then when we have no need of faith, we ſhall have but little need of the body; this was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignified in the <hi>Iſratlites</hi> when they went out of darkneſs, out of bondage to liberty: yet we find
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93651:28"/> they muſt paſſe Jordan before they could enjoy; they muſt go into the land before they can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe; thus thoſe <hi>Realia gaudia,</hi> the reall comforts, the beſt of heaven muſt be for his children, as the beſt of the earth was. <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome is provided for <hi>Sarah</hi> to lye in; her face muſt travile to him; if ſhe will live in his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then ſhe muſt forſake her fathers houſe; ſo if Chriſtians will live under Chriſts ſcepter, they muſt leave their habitation; for his Kingdom is not of this world. The nurſe muſt reſigne when the father calls the child home to his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; the heire ceaſes from being under tutors and governours, when he comes at age, then he enters to his eſtate; they muſt come from under the hedges, and out of the high wayes, that will taſte of Chriſts feaſt; and this is that which God hath intended his for, that they ſhould be <hi>ejus participes,</hi> partakers of himſelf, and ſit with Chriſt upon his throne, and therefore they muſt leave the world; it is not likely for us to graſp the wind, nor to embrace the aire; there is an abſolute contradiction in the capacity; ſo is it with our bodyes that are earthly, before they can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, they muſt be celeſtiall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The beſt of Gods people are for the beſt things, that is for triumph; and therefore they muſt lay down their arms; the Apoſtle calls life a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, which we may conclude to be ſo from the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, that God hath made weapons which are not uſefull but in warre, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">1. A Chriſtian is more then conqueror in this; they are ſlaine in the field, and yet win the day; we do not ordinarily ſay that they are conquerours who are ſlain, but that they are conquered; yet Gods children are ſuch, <hi>verſe</hi> 36. as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, For thy ſake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted ſheep for the ſlaughter; are Chriſtians ſlaine in the field, and yet overcome; dye and yet vanquiſh; fall on the place and yet conquer; what is this but to be more then conquerour through Chriſt who loves us!</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Chriſtian is more then conquerour, in this, becauſe he ſo conquers as never to be aſſaulted more: the grave, death, and hell have ſtruck their laſt ſtroak, and ſin hath done its utmoſt; but is overcome, is falne and will never riſe again; for who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſtifies. And this the Apoſtle tells us of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. where he attributes a peaceable fruit of righteouſneſſe to our being exerciſed, he calls it <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are both joyned in the word, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that peace immediatly follows upon vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; thus when Chriſtians have their ſins ſo blotted out as they ſhall never be legible more, charged upon the ſoul more; when they ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Satan that he never aſſaults more; when they bury death in its own grave that it never riſe more, and ſo charme the ſerpent that he ſting no more, they may be ſaid to be more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Chriſtian is more then a conquerour, doth more then overcome, becauſe he gets the victory without any great damage, or any great loſſe. Afflictions get but the dtoſſe, what the furnace gets from the gold; death and the grave get but the body, and this is but to refine the ſoul; when the groſſe part the body falls off, no great damage, they loſe not their captaine in the war; they loſe not their ſight or their hearing by death, but have all more purified then before; therefore they may be ſaid to be more then conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; it is reported of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> that when he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Romain army with the loſſe of many of his own men, a friend of his came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his victory, to whom he anſwered, <hi>vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus quidem; ſed ſi nobis talis itidem victoria con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigerit, omnino funditus perd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. Laſtly for which I mention the reſt, A Chriſtian may be ſaid to be more then conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, becauſe he triumphs; this is it which he fought for, and this is it that he will lay down his arms for; he cannot then triumph before he go out of the field; the world is the field, and the body the robes wherein the ſoul is cloathed for warre; ſo that when he appears in trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant apparell, it is both in another place, and an other guiſe. After conqueſt the army uſed to go into the City their <hi>Metropolis</hi> that they might there triumph, where the noyſe of their victory would be moſt publique throughout the Land; thus it is with Chriſtians; that there may be an open publication of their conqueſt, they muſt go to heaven to triumph, and therefore leave the body; and indeed who would not lay aſide the fleſh, to be glorified with Chriſt? who would not give a mortall for an immortall body? who would not put off coruption, to be cloathed upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Me thinks I ſhould not need endeavour to diſgrace the world, to thoſe who have ſeen its vanity as we have done; let the preſent condition and poſture of it ſpeak, and it will condemn it ſelf. Sure there needs no arguments to draw us from the earth, who are driven, as it were, by its bad enterrainment it gives us, to ſeek out another place; Oh what ſad

Firſt comes on to the ſtage the honourable and vertuous Lady <hi>Thorney</hi> of <hi>Fenton</hi> in the County <hi>Nottingham,</hi> who came to act the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of this Tragedy; ſhe intending a viſite to her ſiſter the Lady <hi>Hickman</hi> of <hi>Ganisburgh,</hi> only called as ſhe came by, not out of intent, but driven by a providence; and indeed now we may gueſs, why God ſent her, to tell us we were mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; ſhe as ſoon as ever, or rather before we alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Coach, fell ſick of an <hi>Apoplexey,</hi> which according to the nature of that diſeaſe, was <hi>A ſenſu, &amp; totius corporis motu privata, obſtructo cerebro; aeger jecit, ſtertuit, &amp; difficul er ſpiravit;</hi> ſhe lay deprived of ſenſe and motion, the brain obſtructed, the breath difficult, and ſhe ſpeechleſs about the ſpace of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hours, and ſo ſhe expired: after her followed a houſhould ſervant very ſpeedily, who did not only ſhew us that we muſt dye, but how we ought to dye: and there were ſent before the main body, that we ſhould be put in a poſture of reſiſtance; but leſt theſe arguments ſhould not convince us, preſently the Lord proves it by a double demonſtration: the ſon and the mother, the two great Pillars of the family, they fall; and now it is time for us to cry

Surely our hearts idolize the world when nothing but rhe image of death, and that of ſo dear and honourable friends and relations can diſintangle us: and if there ſhould be need farther of preſſing this argument, though indeed it already is come to the quick, yet conſider theſe particulars, leſt it get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour again.</p>

Behold the prize ſet before you, the way made plain, the Invitation gone out, the guide ready, the Father reall, the Table ſpread, meat provided, Gueſts bidden, the day appointed, the Bride-groom adorned to meet his Spouſe. Oh! what things are theſe? Oh! how ought men to live, who conſider this great Preparation? Oh! walk while ye have the light, put not out your own underſtanding, ſtifle not conſcience, charm not the admonitions of your own hearts, blot not out the words of the Goſpel, ſpit not in the face of Chriſt, trample not on his blood: view over your priviledges and ſee what they call for at your hand. Oh! who can laugh when Chriſt weeps, and a ſinners deniall draws tears from his tender eye. Oh! <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> wilt thou ſtill rebell, ſtill proclaim war, when Chriſt is weeping over thee, that thou wouldſt be at peace? Look up, Profeſſor, and view what God hath done for thee: how the Sun is already riſen, the Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers at work, the night approaching, &amp; a ſtorm at hand. Who will love the Cave when the Sun ſhines clearly? See <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 5. When he had conſidered the great deliverance from captivity; ſee the uſe he made, which ſtopped the mouths of the wicked.

Who would not fight might they be ſure to triumph? Who would not obey might they be ſure to raign? There is an improbability that they ſhould Raign who never were ſubject; can he the Scepter ſway or rule, who never yet learned to obey? will a Chriſtian ſtick at any thing, when he hath Heaven in his aim? wil he be ſtop in his way when when the prize is glorious, and ſo ſoon loſt? ſurely the glory of the World ſhould be counted loſſe for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, by whom the World is crucified to you.

Is there more delight in ſtrangers then in the beloved, more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections after the creature then after Chriſt: more han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering after the ſervant then aftet a father: then we are unnaturall children. God will deal as Fathers, ſuch a day thou hadſt ſuch a gift from me and will not that win thee? So God, in the day ſaith the Lord that I brought thee out of Egypt, in the day when I delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee out of the wilderneſſe, in the day when I gave thee bread to eat and water to drink. God reckons the day of his mercy as a father doth, and therefore it will argue unnaturalneſs if he ſhould find the heart on other objects when he comes for our love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are unnaturall, that will not relieve their father: thence the Apo. 1 Tim. 5. 4. calls it a ſhewing piety at home, to require parents: therefore children were not to defraud their father nor abridge him, though they pretended that was conſecrated to an holy uſe which ſhould have nouriſhed him. Matth. 15. 5. though it was Corban, a gift dedicated to the Temple, yet it might be fetched back rather then the Father

Now! alas how doth our unnaturalneſs appear! have not we abridged God our Father, when we could not ſay, it was <hi>Corban</hi> dedicated to the temples? when God hath waited at our door, have we not entertained others? When he hath ſtood to knock, hath not another been in our arms, and in our imbraces? when he would have had an hours ſervice, have not we pretended we have been buſie; we had Oxen to try, ground to till, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh, doth not this ſpeak us to be unnatural chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; we have not wearied God with the fat of our offerings; <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath been hungry, and we would let him ſtarve at the door, he hath been naked, and we pitied him not, unnatural children. It is ſaid, that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Tudorus,</hi> a Huxters ſon, received of <hi>Charls</hi> the ninth of <hi>France,</hi> in ſome, years 600000 crowns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all degrees of honour that he was capable of; and all the good that the King had of him, was onely this, that he learned of him to ſwear by the name of God: <hi>A bad</hi> requital for ſuch kindneſs; thus we deal with our Father.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are unnatural who deride their Father, they who make a mock at the wayes of God, at purity, that jeare at holineſs, and deſpiſe a ſtrict converſation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 16. <hi>Curſed be he that ſetteth light by his Father or Mother, and all the people ſhall ſay, amen.</hi> There are many ſuch unnatural children who ſet light by their Fathers command, that contemne the goſpel, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride and ſcoff at Heaven, there are two ſorts of theſe.</p>

                  <p>AS to our Brethren in the World, thoſe with whom we have to live, the men that we converſe among two things only.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Walk in love, then may one be ſaid to be in love, when love hath the command, when it is ſupreme: as a man may be ſaid to be in drink, when that hath got the predominancy. Thus you ſhould not onely love, but be ſervants of it, which is to have the ſame mind in us, that was in Chriſt Jeſus: and though this be a primer Leſſon, one of the firſt rudiments, to love our neighbour as our ſelf; yet there is need that ſome hear it repeated over again, for they have not learned it yet. Conſider theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To love one another is the command of God, the new command of Chriſt, and that it ſhould be more cheerfully obeyed, he hath ſet us an example, ſuch a one as was never ſet before, that one ſhould dye for his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. and this is the commandement, <hi>That we ſhould believe on the name of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another as he gave us command.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To love one another, is a ſign that God loves us, for this produceth a ſimilitude with God, which is a ground of love. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. Hereby perceive wee the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To love one another teſtifies the truth to be in us. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 20. <hi>If a man ſay he loves God, and yet hateth his brother, he is a Lyar. He is not in Chriſt</hi>

                     </gap> that wherein Chriſtians have been taught from the beginning.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Love is a neceſſary conſequence of Gods love to us, the end of that love was to generate its likeneſs in man, as Chriſtargues his mercy and perfection; and humility and righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to do; all aime at producing their likeneſs in the ſoul, thus love, 1 <hi>Jobn</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Beloved if God ſo loved us we ought to love one another;</hi> there ſhould be a converſion into the nature of God by conſidering the love of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Love is of the nature of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 7, 8. 12, 13. 16. <hi>Let us love one another, for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God; and knoweth God, he that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love; no man hath ſeen God at any time, if we love one another God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. God is love and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God and God in him.</hi> And if we conſider, love is of equal exiſtence with the ſupream being, the firſt emanation of God, and the Original glimpſe, the morning, or firſt dawning of his perſon was not viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or knowable under any notion before this, to wit his love, for that broke forth in the firſt creation as <hi>Anteeedan cons</hi> to his power: and how doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John</hi> run immediately to the explanation of the grand myſtery of the Trinity, from the pretious conſidering of the love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. for if we rightly conſider we ſhall find that Demiurgical love, hath the ſame propinquity and affinity to the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93651:65"/> and is as apparent at the firſt view; as Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal goodneſſe the ſourſe of life, or <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And laſtly, To love one another teſtifies that we are paſt from death to life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him that is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and he that doth this is born of God, which is a paſſing from death to life; 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 14. <hi>We know that we are paſſed from death to life becauſe we love the brethren, he that loveth not his brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in death.</hi> And 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. unto the 4 <hi>verſe,</hi> there are remarkable paſſages; we may gather theſe notes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though the fall or firſt ſin brought man into the ſtate of death, yet there was life in the boſome of the Father, <hi>verſe</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe who were eye-witneſſes of this life, were ſo gratiouſly qualified with the communicative nature, received from Chriſt, that they imparted the knowledge of this life to us, that we ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our ſelves in the ſtate of death without hope of eſcaping, <hi>verſe</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lords wiſdom appeared ſo much in this communication, that the firſt meſſage that ſhould be delivered, ſhould be the firſt ground of credency, namely that God is light and in him there is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at all, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. Who cannot deceive nor be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To ſay we partake of the nature of God, and have a reſemblance to his image, and yet not be of this communicative ſpirit, not to love our brethren; This is to lye, and that is deceipt and darkneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God who is light, and contrary to Chriſt who is truth: that muſt need be a lye and darkneſſe

                  <p n="5">5. The fellowſhip or communion with, or partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of this light, and truth and life, is manifeſted by this; our love one to another, our communication one to another. And this is a paſſing from death to life, from darkneſs to light, for illumination enlivens and the more the ſoul partakes of the light or the more it is conformed to the firſt principle of truth, the more it is a live: ſo that to affirm ſigns of life where thcre is no love to the brethren; is all one as to affirm expert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the way when one is born blinde and could never ſee. Sin is death, grace life, which grace muſt be meaſured according to the Law, which Law the Apoſtle epitomizeth <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 14. The Law is in a word <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> and in this ſimilitude the pattern of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, the image of God is placed, as well as in knowledge and dominion. This is the conformity to the Law, which will ſpeak one juſt, the great Law is, ſaith Chriſt, there is one God to be believed; and the Law like unto this, is, <hi>That we must love our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as our ſelves.</hi> Evangelical righteouſneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a participation of the nature of Chriſt, I mean in <hi>fore humane,</hi> now was not this ſubſtantial love as conſpicuous in his life as his holineſs or as his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or truth? ſo that that muſt needs witneſs it ſelf to be a branch of that tree of life which brings forth the ſame fruits.</p>

Ioint-Embaſſadours, Miniſters I mean, ought not to differ about their private inſtructions if they can agree about their publique.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93651:88"/> ſo ignorant of ſoul affairs, they cannot be awakened they will ſlumber on theit life; thence is it that men ſee not the glorious joys that are in Heaven, the refreſhing ſhowers of pleaſure that flow at the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right hand, and the drops of conſolation that feed the heart. Thence is it that we ſee not Chriſt ſtanding at the door, till his hair be filled with dew and his locks with the drops of the night; we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep and ſo blind and ignorant, of what belongs to our peace: nay this is the reaſon why God may ſtand by us many times and we not riſe, be aſleep, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 16. The Lord ſurely was in this place and <hi>Jacob</hi> knew it not, and the reaſon is becauſe <hi>Jacob</hi> was not awaked out of his ſleep. Therefore are we ſo alienated from divine contemplation, becauſe of our blindneſs and ignorance, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. having their underſtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in rhem. Wonderful priviledges, ſtrange providences, remarkable proviſions nothing regarded; when a poor ſoul is aſleep, glimpſes of Chriſts, footſteps of the Father, the voice of God in the clouds, in the heart, in providences not at all regarded, when we are aſleep. And it is not only a time or a condition when we ſee nothing; but a ſtate where we judge falſely, we miſconſtrue all appearances, and our fancy rules us, we judge all things to be well with us, that we were inceaſed with goods, and ſtood in need of nothing, but alas! men aſleep only dream of happineſs that is not ſo. Thus <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 King. 3. thought he had a long diſcourſe with God, where great things were promiſed, large priviledges, joyful tidings but he awakened and behold it was a dream
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93651:88"/> Oh will it not be thus with men who are aſleep; they thought they ſaw Heaven open, and the Angels aſcending and deſcending, they thought they had made a fair progreſs towards the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they thought they ſaw themſelves clothed in white and following the Lamb, they thought they ſaw themſelves among thoſe ten thouſand worſhippers who had waſhed their garments in Chriſts bloud and were become whiter then ſnow. But alas! they are aſleep, and when they awake it proves but a dream, and as they judge falſely and miſconſtrue their own condition, ſo do they miſconſtrue the condition of the children of God, they thought true Chriſtians to be a deſpicable and an unworthy generation, as <hi>Eli</hi> judged of <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1, 13, 14. becauſe ſhe prayed in her heart and made no ſuch cry as many in thoſe dayes made he thought <hi>Hannah</hi> had been drunken, thus theſe men that are aſleep they think every Chriſtian a fool and every ſincere convert an ideot, they think the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be in jeſt that Chriſt doth but to terrifie them. That Gods holieſt children are but a many giddy headed childiſh people, but alas! they dream but they are aſleep, and ſo they cannot paſs a true judgement of things: like thoſe <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 29. 8. their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of their own happineſs is even as a dream in a night viſion; as a hungry man when he dreameth and behold he eateth but he awakeenth, and his ſoul is empty; or as when a thirſty man dreameth and behold he drinketh, but he awakeneth and behold he is faint, and his ſoul hath appetite; therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake

We ſhould keep out of a ſecure drowſie ſleepy poſture, becauſe elſe we ſhall be looked only as dead men? <hi>plurima mortis imago,</hi> there is a reſemblance to death in ſleep and a ſimilitude of the grave in the bed; <hi>ut mortis ſomnus, ſic lectus imago ſepulchri.</hi> Therefore the ſpirit of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1, 2. as ſoon as ever it had told the Church of <hi>Sardis that it had but a name to live but was dead,</hi> the immediate remedy which follows in the 2 <hi>verſe</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

In both all ſenſes and motion is ceaſed, ears to hear and the dead man hears not; no more doth the man aſleep? eyes to ſee and neither he that is dead nor he that is aſleep ſees. Head to underſtand but they underſtand not; as in a dead carcaſs no breath, no life, no ſence, no motion, pale faces, cold hands, ſtiff hearts, altogether ſtupid, ſenſeleſs; ſo in thoſe that are aſleep and ſecure ſhake them they feel not, cry alovd in their eats they know not what you ſay, chatm never ſo ſweetly they ſtop their ears. Thus <hi>Epaminondas</hi> did with his ſervant whom he ſound aſleep in the face of his enemy; he run him through and ſaid <hi>mortuum inveni, &amp; mortuum reliqui.</hi> I left him as I found him, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:93651:89"/> 2. As there is a privation of motion or ſence in thoſe that are aſleep, ſo there is no deſire of changr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the condition. The dead deſire not to riſe, no-the ſleepy in that ſtate deſire to be awakened, go and ſtir one out of his ſlumber and he wil ſcarce thank you? Oh he would not be moleſted he was in a ſweet ſleep, in a pleaſant dream and was ſecure, and thought no harm (nor no good neither) he took his reſt with much content, he was in a rare dream and Oh what pleaſant ſights did he ſee and why did you moleſt him? Thus it is with ſecure ſleepy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they are well as they are; they would not be troubled with too frequent thoughts of Heaven, they can do well enough without ſuch a ſtir, and they have a minde to be at quiet like the evil ſpirits, <hi>Mark</hi> 1, 2 4. <hi>crying out, let us alone what have we to do with thee thou</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>art thou come to deſtroy us and torment us before our time?</hi> Oh! therefore take heed of ſuch a ſtate, becauſe it is ſo like death.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To be aſleep fruſtrates the expectation of Chriſt, lays us open to temprations; and impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth the ſoul.

When he had the management of the Reconciliation of man put into his hand, he ſtood in a threefold capacity: in as much as 3. things were very requiſite as conducible to the reduction of them, who had made defection from God. For he had to do with a very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and groſſe generation, men who were almoſt metamorphoſed into Brutes, and had loſt that clear apprehenſion of divine truth: therefore he comes in the capacity of a great <hi>Rabbi,</hi> a Prophet, a Maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Teacher. So he found not only ignorance but alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wicked works had made them averſe to come to the knowledge of the truth, to the participation of God therefore he became a Prieſt for ever, that hee might reconcile them to God and God to them, and this was not all, but he found a reluctancy from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and from without, in oppoſition to the knowledge of the truth, therefore he became King or appeared under that qualification and capacity: there was an <hi>impotenti a redeundi,</hi> an impotency of returning to him from whom they had made defection, ſo that power muſt be exerciſed as wel as wiſdome and mercy: by the one he is conſidered as a Prophet, by the other as a Prieſt, for mercy became him that he might have compaſſion on the ignorant, and thoſe which were

                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:93651:111"/> Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was bold, but it was when he had the Kings Majeſties ſtrength a long with him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 12, 13. <hi>I know how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound, every where and in all things I am inſtructed; both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to ſuffer need, I can do all things,</hi> a great word, but it is <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengthened him.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> he will go, but it muſt be in the ſtrength of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 16.

                  <p n="4">4. If Chriſt be King then let us beware of three things, which are great impediments of his ruleing over us.

                  <p n="1">1. Pride ſpurns at the very foundation of the Kingdom: the reaſon why they would have no ſuperior, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 4, 5. they had a tongue ſpeaking ſwelling words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> great things ſtipped with pride, who have ſaid with our tongue we will prevaile, our lips are our own, who ſhall be Lord over us, or controule us? This was the reaſon too why <hi>Joſeph</hi> fared ſo hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his brethren, becauſe their ſlaves were to do obedience to his, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 8. <hi>and his breth en ſaid to him, ſhall you indeed reign over us? or ſhall you have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:93651:111"/> 
                     <hi>over us? and they hated him yet the more.</hi> So his Father was diſpleaſed, when he dreamed that the Sun and Moon and the eleven ſtars made obeyſeance, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. pride cannot indure a ſuperior, no more then love can bear a rival. Thus ſpiritual pride is a great hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to Chriſts ſupremacy: Phariſaical righteouſneſs will not vail to the Scepter of Chriſt. Oh take heed of that to be juſt onely in your own eyes, is not to be juſt at all. Thus the <hi>Phariſees</hi> conceit of freedom kept them in perpetual bondage, <hi>John</hi> 8. 32. 33. Chriſt tells you he was come to make you free, and they anſwer, we are <hi>Ahrahams</hi> ſeed, and were never in bondage to any man: how ſayeſt thou: ye ſhall be made free: if you conceit your ſelves whole: then you will cry, what need of the Phyſician? if you have ſtrength of your own, you will not be beholden to Chriſt: take heed of pride.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take heed of covetouſneſs, this is an enemy to dominion both temporal and ſpiritual. This is clear in <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who had the Giants invading his dignity, it was becauſe they were greedy and he rich when he had no garments to divide then there was no traytors, <hi>donec erat pervus, donec puerilia ſenſit, incoluit:</hi> when he was empty he had not your envy, <hi>ſed mox regno victor adempto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as ſoon as he was got into the Throne, <hi>illa propago, contemptrix ſuperum, avidiſſima divitiarum, affectaſſe ferunt, regum coeleſte gigantes.</hi> Then that greedy generation, contemners of dignity, deſpiſers of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they attempt to de-Throne him. Other inſtances of this might be brought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not done in corners; but I will not rip up old ſores, they bleed already.</p>
                  <p>Thus in ſpirituall ſupremacy, this is a great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93651:112"/> covetouſneſſe which is idolatry, and when any thing beſides Chriſt takes place in the heart, when the creature is taken into our boſome, then is Chriſt caſt at the foot-ſtool, the ground of the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens rebellion againſt the ſon whom they ſhould have reverenced, was this greedy appetite; this is the heir let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours. When the world is got into the heart there is no room for Chriſt, and if that be ſo pretious in our eye it will abate that eſteem which we ought to have of Chriſt our Soveraign and King.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take heed of ſelf-love; this alſo hates domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, thus when the Oracle had told <hi>Saturn</hi> that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> ſhould rule in his ſtead, he preſently wages war with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> it was for his own preſervation, though he went againſt the Oracle; therefore was it that the <hi>Jews</hi> hated Chriſt. They had taken it into ſerious conſideration, and debated in their councel and the determination was, not to let him alone, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 11. 48. there you may ſee the ground of your deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, if we let him alone, all men will believe on him, but this was it which lay at the bottom, namely they feared leaſt the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould come and take away their place, their poſſeſſion; and their Nation. Where ſelf is at the bottom of deſigns then the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker muſt be trampled on, and the Law oblitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt in his dominion is oppoſed by this ſelf-love, when men know that they are full; or at leaſt fancy they are full and ſtand of nothing they are not come to the fountain.</p>

                  <p> Poor ſoules have a tendency to pleaſe the fleſh; and ſhould they become Chriſts ſubjects, then they muſt put off ſelf, and that goes ſore; what follow a beloved ſin to its death, and a <hi>Dalilah</hi> to the grave! no they will rather oppoſe then ſubmit to him, who will not be content that they may be his followers and bring their corruptions with them, but muſt forſake all, and take up the croſſe; this is the reaſon that many will not come at heaven, becauſe they muſt not carry their ſins with them; Theſe three may be called Kings evils, whoſe ſwelling if it be not ſome way abated by the gentle touch of the Kings hand, they will turne to gangreens, if not to a plague.</p>

                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:93651:115"/>
                  <p> Thus <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> ſet the <hi>Levites</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets for Judgement and Controverſies; and they ſhould ever warn them that they treſpaſs not againſt the Lord, and ſo wrath come upon them, and upon all their brethren. Thus <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 2, 3, 4, 5 6. <hi>They ſhall take a man of their Coaſts, and ſet him for a Watchman; if when he ſee the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet come upon the Land, he blow the Trumpet, and warn the people, then whoſoever heareth the ſound of the Trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the ſword come, and take him away, his blood ſhall be on his own head.

                  <p>Thus Chriſt he is a Prophet; he warns the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; this was his Meſſage into the word, which he diſcovered in the Goſpel, namely, to warn the people that that they ſhould flee from the wrath to come; and not only in perſon, but he ſent his Meſſengers for this purpoſe. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 20. 31, <hi>Who by the ſpace of three years, ceaſed not to warn every man night and day with tears.</hi> Alſo <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>Chriſt the hope of glory, whom they preached, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wiſdome, that they might preſent every man perfect in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  </p>

                     </gap>. A light revealed, a light in order to a farther manifeſtation of God to the Gentles. This teſtimony Chriſt gives of himſelf, who like other light cannot make a falſe repreſentation of its ſelf. <hi>John</hi> 12. 46. <hi>I am come a light into the world, that whoſoever believeth in me ſhould not abide in darkneſs.</hi> Chriſt hath all the properties of light; to this purpoſe conſider a few particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Light was the firſt Creature in the viſible cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that God ſaw any beauty in. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>God ſaid let there be light, and there was ligbt;</hi> till then the earth was without form and void, a Chaos,
<q>Rudis indigeſtaque moles.</q> and darkneſs was upon the face of the whole earth.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt is the light, in whom the Father takes complacency, and in him alſo doth he accept of men. <hi>In whom we have redemption,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 7. <hi>In whom we are made acceptable,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 6. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3. 17. He is the <hi>Benjamin</hi> whom we muſt carry with us, or we muſt not ſee the Lords face; <hi>For without faith in him it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Light is good; and this appeared as ſoon as it was created. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>God ſaw the light that it was good, and God put a diſtinction between the light and between the darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt will be acknowledged by all thoſe whom he hath redeemed from <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs, that he is good. You that have taſted of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93651:117"/> I appeal to your own experiences; as for thoſe that have not taſted, they will not believe, becauſe they ſee not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Light manifeſteth it ſelf and other things to the eye; light diſcovers it ſelf and other Creatures to the underſtanding. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>But all things that are diſcovered, are made manifeſt to the light; for whatſoever doth make manifeſt, is light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt he bore witneſs, or manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>John</hi> 8. 16, 17, 18. <hi>I judge of my ſelf, and my judgement is true: Is it not written in your Law, that the witneſs of two men is true?</hi> Deut. 17. 6. <hi>I am one that bear witneſs of my ſelf; but yet I am not alone; the Father that ſent me, beareth witneſs of me alſo.</hi> Thus <hi>John</hi> 14. 21. <hi>They that keep the Commandments, love the Father; and ſuch Chriſt will love, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf unto.</hi> So he manifeſts his Father glory. John 17. 6. <hi>I have manifeſted thy name to the men which thou gaveſt me; I have declared thy name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and will declare it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Light reproves, judges, betrayes or condemns: thence falſe Teachers abide not the light, becauſe it detects them. Falſe Wares are not vendible, but in the dark; thence is it that the Workers of iniquity ſeek darkneſs and the ſhadow of death, that they may hide themſelves, <hi>Job</hi> 34. 22.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt he diſcovers, betrayes, judges, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, condemns; therefore a believing in Chriſt is an exemption from condemnation, and not a Believing in Chriſt is Condemnatio. See for this, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20. A very clear place, <hi>He that believeth on him, is not condemned; but he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:93651:118"/> 
                     <hi>not, is condemned already; and this is the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that Light is come into the world, and men love darknſs rather then light, becauſe their deeds are evil; for every one that doth evil, hateth the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved; but he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought of God.</hi> Here we may ſee Chriſt is the light that both manifeſteth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Light is a pleaſant Object, and deſireable; it draws the eye, clears the heart of all Creatures that are not blind; whither it appear in a Spark, a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, a Comet, a Star, a Worm, a Meteor, or in the Sun, it ia very pleaſant; it is akin to the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, pleaſant to the eye, and a thing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to make one wiſe: therefore the Epithite of <hi>Aurora</hi> the morning, is <hi>jucunda;</hi> the Epithite of the night, <hi>Opaca, tenebroſa, horribilis,</hi> darkneſs and horror.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt, he is light, the pleaſant morning Star, the day-ſpring from on high. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 7, 8. Very deſireable; for Nations that knew not him ſhall run unto him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 5. Thus when the Watchmen knew not what the Spouſes beloved was more then another beloved, ſhe tells them that he is white and ruddy, the chief among ten thouſand; and thence is it that the promiſed ſeed is called <hi>The Deſire of all Nations. Hag.</hi> 2. 6, 7. Once more I will ſhake the heavens, and the earth, and the ſea, and the dry land, and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93651:118"/> I will fill this houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Light is ſuch a thing, that without it ones happineſs cannot be compleated. We look upon them as objects of pity, who cannot ſee, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apprehend the light. Thus it ſeems to be as great an Emphaſis of the curſe for diſobedience, as any that can be expreſſed. <hi>Deut.</hi> 38. 28, 29. The Lord will ſmite thee with madneſs, and blindneſs, and aſtoniſhment of heart; and thou ſhalt groap at noon-day, as the blind groapeth in darkneſs; and thou ſhalt not proſper in thy wayes, and thou ſhalt be only oppreſſed and ſpoiled evermore, and no man ſhall ſave thee.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt is the Light; him, without whom we muſt neceſſarily be miſerable. May not every poor ſoul cry out as <hi>Abraham</hi> in deſire of a ſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 2. Lord, what wilt thou give me, if I go childleſs! May not ſelf-condemning ſinners cry in the ſame language, Lord, What will become of us, if we go Chriſtleſs! Hence it was that the Apoſtle could count all things loſs that he might gain Chriſt. He would be willing to be a fool for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord.

In the hand-writing of ordinances or traditions, or Judaical ceremonies, meats, and drinks, and holy dayes, and new Moons, and Sabbaths, which things were ſhadows (only dark adumbrations of things to come) but the body is of Chriſt: ſo that as the Tabernacle ceaſed, when they got a Temple, and the ſacrifice ceaſed when redemption was made,

                  <p>Thus Chriſt is light, obſcure as to his birth, after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck, Heb.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>Without Father, and without mother, without deſcent or pedigree, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither begining of days, nor end of life: but made like unto the ſon of God abideth a Prieſt for ever.</hi> Joh. 9. 29. <hi>As for Moſes we know: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.</hi>

As the branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the vine: no more can ye, except ye abides in me.

How Chriſt brings in this as a conſequence of their felation, Ye are the ſalt of the earth; but if the ſalt have loſt its ſavour, it is then good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to be troden under foot; <hi>Ye are the light of the world; but men light not candles, to put them under a buſhel, but on a candleſtick and it giveth light unto all that are in the houſe. Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they ſeeing your good works, may glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi> This is commendable in ſtarrs, in darkeſt nights they ſhine the brighteſt; Are there not many in the Land, of whom I have hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93651:122"/> and now ſpeak in heavineſſe of heart, who are enemies to this great light, haters of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet? who do not only ſit in darkneſſe themſelves, but inſtead of reflecting the Sun beams ecclipſe them; whoſe dark converſation miſguids and blinds more then their bright doctrine leads and informs; what do the ſtars in heaven if they reflect not the beames of of the Sun? and what do the candleſticks in the Church if they be not ſupporters of the light? I hope my boldneſſe is pardonable; I do not take upon me peremptorily to direct thoſe reverend and holy, of whom I am not aſhamed to aske infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; yet a ſmall candle may diſcover the beam, as well as a torch can do the mote; as for the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and painfull in the Lords vineyard, they are not concerned: what I ſay is not intended to you; and as for the impious, and prophane (for <hi>(proh dolor!)</hi> I know of both ſorts,) I am not concerned what they think of me; Oh that none of the veſſels of the ſanctuary might be empty veſſels, nor thoſe dry breſts that are ſet, or that have undertaken to feed and fill a hungry and an empty people.</p>
                  <p>Oh how neceſſary is a capacious judgment, and how dangerous is it to ceaſe drawing untill it be full! it is more commendable to have a profound and a deep underſtanding then a gliding &amp; voluble tongue; though it be requiſite in the Prophet to ſpeak, yet more requiſite to know; therefore of old the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were called ſeers, workers, and labourers, but never till of late dayes that I meet with were they called Speakers; nay, Propheſie by the Apoſtle is preferred before ſpeaking with tongues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 5. <hi>I would that you all ſpake with tongues, but</hi>

                  <p>Two things that make the condition calamitous, and that is when the Prophets are either ignorant or unclean; theſe you may ſee in the Propheſie of <hi>Hoſen;</hi> Hoſ. 4. 6. <hi>My people are deſtroyed for lack of knowledge; becauſe thou haſt rejected knowledge, I will alſo reject thee; thou ſhalt be no Prieſt to me, ſeeing thou haſt forgot the Law of thy God.</hi> And what ſhall they be then, that never knew the Law of their God! And as for pollution or defilement, ſee the ſame Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9. 7, 8, 9. <hi>The dayes of viſitation are come, and the day of recompence is come;</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, not only becauſe the Prophet is a fool, and the ſpiritual man mad, <hi>but for the multitude of their iniquity, and their great hatred, and becauſe the man of the Spirit</hi> (for ſo Prophets are called) <hi>hateth the houſe of God, and they have corrupted themſelves, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will the Lord remember their iniquity, he will vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite their ſin.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle promotes that <gap reason="foreign">

In that day the Prophets ſhall be aſhamed every one of his viſion, when he hath propheſied; neither ſhall they wear a rough garment to deceive; there is much danger when the Prophets propheſie plenty againſt a year of Famine; and Peace againſt a year of War, and ſalvation to ſinners, when they are at the very brinks of hell. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 13, 14, 15. Then ſaid I, Ah Lord God, Behold the Prophets ſay unto

But the Prophet which ſhall preſume to ſpeak a word in my name, which <hi>I</hi> have not commanded him to ſpeak, or that ſhall ſpeak in the name of other gods, that Prophet ſhall ſurely dye; and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the vulgar may ſay of revelations, though they are not in that manner viſible to bodily eyes as formerly; yet the Meſſengers of God have private inſtructions many times what to deliver; he of old ſpake by the Prophets, &amp; now in latter times he hath ſpake by Chriſt; and thoſe that he fends, though they cannot clearly diſcern this appearance, who have not the Sun riſen upon them, for the Goſpel is myſterious, yet there is a revelation made by the Sun. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. They are indeed humble truths, and therefore a Phariſaical people will not ſtoop
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93651:125"/> into the grave to find them. God makes his own his Secretaries, thoſe to whom he reveals himſelf; the ſecrets of the Lord are with them that fear him; and though ſome have made bad uſe of this mercy in promoting their own dreams in pretence of Goſpel revelation, and under a colour of divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, have promoted their diabolical deluſions, which may make a ſober man look upon them rather as Enthuſiaſts then Prophets; yet if that be Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm which <hi>Suidas</hi> calls ſo, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="1">1. Take warning of the Prophets; When you hear Chriſts voice, or the voice of his Meſſengers, be diligent, and hearken; What! will no perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, no terror, no threats divert your courſes, nor ſtop you in the way! then you cannot miſs the pit, if you go forward; hath God ſet Watchmen to preſerve your ſouls! for ſo Prophets are called; then the enemy will ſuppreſs you, and deſtroy. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 3, 4, 5. <hi>If the Watchmen ſee the ſword come upon the Land, and blow the Trumpet, and warn the people, then whoſoever heareth the ſound of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and taketh not warning, if the ſword come and</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prize the Prophets of Chriſt according to their worth; it is dangerous to abridge the Prophets of what is their own: See <hi>Abimeleck</hi> reproved for it in a dream by God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 7. Now therefore reſtore the man his wife, for he is a Prophet, and he ſhall pray for thee, and thou ſhalt live; and if you reſtore her not, know you that you ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die; you, and all that are thine; Men are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued according to their ſerviceableneſs; now we may ſee what remarkable ſervice the Prophets have done in other times beſides their wonders, and their acceptableneſs with God; ſee <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>And by a Prophet the Lord brought Iſrael out of Egypt, and by a Prophet was he preſerved;</hi> And ſee what a Promiſe Chriſt leaves upon Record, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 40, 41. <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me.

Thus when <hi>Jeroboams</hi> hand was healed by the Prophet, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites the Prophet home, and profers him a reward. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 7, 8. But alas! have not the Prophets, the Meſſengers of Chriſt, cauſe now to compalin, Who hath believed our report, or to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed! <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 1. Or may not the Lords Meſſengers make the ſame

They cryed with a loud voice, and ſtopped their ears, and ran upon him, and caſt him out of the City, and ſtoned him with ſtones; and was not this the very crime that Chriſt layes againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for whoſe deſolation he wept! <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 34. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee!</hi> A heavy crime, and the judgment is as heavy, no leſs then deſolation.

                  <p n="3">3. Labour for the truth, and the knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it is in Jeſus the great Prophet; and the way to know, is to enquire of Chriſt, who is the infallible Moderator of Controverſal points; it is dangerous to abide in error, like the ſandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: what Superſtructure ſoever is laid upon it, it will not abide the ſtorm; it is no ſafe rock either for a Kings Throne, of <hi>Peters Chair,</hi> and it is more deformed when it comes from the Prophet; <hi>Corruptio optimi peſſima,</hi> greateſt lights becoming

Now beloved, as ever you would eome to the expected home, labour that you miſs not your way; as ever you tender miſſing hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and loſing your own ſouls, inquire after the truth, follow Chriſt this great Prophet and Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who cannot miſguide, who cannot deceive; it is in his breſt that truth is hid, in his Goſpel that it is diſcovered: ſo the meaſure of judging as well as walking, the line or rule for opinions as well as converſation, is the Goſpel; and to differ from that is to be diſorderly, to be Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 14. and this was typified to us under the Law, that in Chriſt only was the ultimate reſolve of dubious inquiries, and that was from their <hi>

Oh are there not many in the world, nay profeſſors that deal thus with Chriſt! take heed of wounding him that hath ſuch a deſcerning eye, that nothing can be hid from; think that Chriſt only winks at you, but he will not put it up.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Humble your ſelves and hearken what Chriſt ſaith by his meſſengers; this was part of the evil which was percedaneous to the captivity, that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> humbled not himſelf, before <hi>Jtremiah</hi> the Prophet, ſpeaking from the mouth of the Lord; and not only <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> but alſo the people mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets. untill the wrath of the Lord roſe againſt the people, untill there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; a ſad ſtate to be diſeaſed and to deſpiſe the Phyſition: a dangerous journey, when the travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour miſuſes the Guide. We read that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his ſolemn ſacrifices were all ordered according to the commandment of <hi>Gad</hi> the Kings ſeer, and of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> the Prophet; 2 <hi>Chor.</hi> 29. 25.

Oh then what meane you to ſtop your eares, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe obedience when their commands are no more then what they have received from their Lord and your Lord! and conſider if you will not hear, what Chriſt your Prophet ſhall ſay at your perill, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22, 23. <hi>And Moſes ſaid unto the fathers, A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him ſhall ye hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93651:128"/> ſpeak the truth are hated; it is a ſigne that iniquity domineers, and every one refuſes to take directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then it ſhews that they make no difference of wayes, the way to heaven or hell is of the ſame moment with them, ſo they be but paſſing forwards; Oh Chriſtians, if Chriſt be a Prophet, then ſit in the light, &amp; have not fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſſe, but rather reprove them! <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 11. Shall the children of the borders, be wiſer then the children of the Kingdome! will the one hate the light for fear of reproof, and will not the other hate darkneſs for fear of defilement! will one hate light, for fear it correct him! and will not the other hate the darkneſſe, for fear it corrupt him! we need not be afraid of ſunburning or ſurfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by Goſpel-truth; though we look worſe in the eye of the world, yet better in the eye of Chriſt; though black, yet comly; though contemptible to the wicked, yet deſireable to Chriſt; and is it not more refreſhing for yout ſoules to ſit under the warme beames of the ſun, then to loſe your ſelves, and groap in Egyptian darkneſſe? Is it not more noble and praiſe worthy to contemplate Gods glory, and inquire in the temple, then to feed our ſwiniſh nature in the cave, and den of fleſhly delights? but becauſe ſome ſeem to have good grounds of their contrary walking, &amp; a ſufficient pledge for their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to obey the command of the Prophet, I ſhall a little examine them, and leave them to fall of their ſelves; and moſt of their objections, may be brought under theſe foure.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some refuſe to come to the light of this great Prophet, becauſe it is too glorious an object for
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93651:129"/> their eyes; they are not able to behold it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſire to be excuſed; they tell us, they are not Eagle-eyed, and they cannot look upon the brightneſſe of the ſun; they cannot peirce into Goſpel myſteries, they are not able to diſcerne any brightneſſe in them, which others admire ſo much. I ſhall only ſay this to ſuch, if you cannot behold that brightneſſe, and cannot look upon the Goſpel-truth and the Sun of righteouſneſſe, then you are not right bred: you are not of the ſecond birth; your eye is weak, you your ſelves are aliens and forraigners, borne in ſome cold Climate, if you cannot behold the ſun, when you come under the Aequator, the place where it ſhines brighteſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others refuſe to come under the light of this Prophet, becauſe the light is not conveyed in the chanel which they are impropriators of, or at leſt claime a propriety in; when light is not conveyed in their line, they ſuffer it not to come near their eye when the Prophet comes not in the way wherein they uſe to travail, they will not receive him; nay, many ſtubborn hearts will not entertaine a meſſage, if the meſſenger come not in the way which they uſe to walk in, though his way be plaine, and his meſſage neceſſary, for life and death; now this is not fair dealing with Chriſt; may not he who is the way, be permitted to chuſe his own ſteps; or ſhall Chriſt rare worſe, or the truth have harder entertainment, becauſe it is diſpenced by one you love not, or by one you know not? ſhall want of affection to the diſpencer alienate your hearts from the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? This is not ingenuous.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Others ſay, they fear, being made black and contemptible, if they ſhould fit under the light of this

                  <p n="4">4. Others will not come to the Prophet, becauſe he tells them of their faults: not to the light, becauſe it detects their errors; they hate the light for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering, and the Prophet for telling the truth; they will not come to the light, for fear their deeds be reproved; O in my aprehenſion, this is a great impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, for none love to be told of their miſdemei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; many therefore hate the light, becauſe they fear it: <hi>oderint quem metuunt,</hi> and ſearching miniſters are rendered odious, becauſe they repreſent ſinners as they are; now how irrational is this, ſhall fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told of his faults make the child go to bed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his father bleſſing? ought jealouſie of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to make the malefactor hate the judge? this
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93651:130"/> was the reaſon why the evil ſpirits could not abide Chriſt, becauſe he came to condemn them before their time; therefore did <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren hate him, becauſe he was to be their overſeer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 18. poor ſoul, is this the reaſon why thou wilt not come to the Touch-ſtone, for fear of being diſcovered! then it is an argument thou art not currant: dareſt thou not come and lie in the light, and let the Goſpel, the Prophet come and paſſe ſentence on the colour of thy ſins! then they may be ſuſpected to be of a ſcarlet dye; Oh how ſad is it to lie in this ſtate! ſure it is nothing but darkeneſs that makes men love darkneſſe: and if men love darkneſſe rather then light, then it is a ſigne their deeds are evil; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how ſad it is to lie in darkneſſe, and you will the ſooner be drawn to the light; is not darkeneſſe a ſtate wherein one may eaſily erre? the poor ſoul wonders, it doth not travaile, which is in darkneſſe, though it go never ſo faſt; may not thy ſoul eaſily be taken priſoner, eaſily robbed, ſoon be ſlain, when thou art in darkneſſe? nothing but miſtakes; every bird looks like a Vulture, and every beaſt like a beaſt of prey; every ſin looks like the ſin againſt the holy Choſt: &amp; every ſpark of grace, like the grace of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when you paſſe ſentence in the dark.

                  <p n="1">1. The reſemblance between the High Prieſt and Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The high Prieſt of the Jews was to be the firſt-born, therefore we read that every firſt-born was to be ſanctified from the womb: there was a holineſs
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:93651:131"/> that did diſtinguiſh them from the vulgar, thence called <hi>Profanum vulgus,</hi> becauſe not reputed ſo holy as the firſt born; therefore we read that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> is called a prophane perſon for ſelling his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16. That is, he loſt the right of being Prieſt (for that was the right of the firſt-born) and he became one of the common people. That the firſt-born was thus ſeparated, we ſind, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Sanctifie unto me all the firſt born; whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver openeth the womb, both of man and of beaſt, it is mine.</hi> The firſt born of beaſts to be the ſacrifice: of man, to be the ſacrificer: and if they were not ſet a part for the Lord, then they were to be redeemed for five pieces of ſilver, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 20. Which ſum amounted to the price that Chriſt was ſold for; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt born was in a peculiar manner given to the Lord; thus it was an unwonted thing, very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that one firſt borne ſhould not be chief, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 10. Since the chief of the ſons of <hi>Hoſah,</hi> and it is added in a parentheſis, (although he was not the firſt borne, yet his father had made him the chief) as though it croſſed the cuſtome uſed amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt is High Prieſt, the firſt borne, the chief of the family of God (redeemed ſhall I ſay) indeed the Jews paid the price of his redemption, thirty pieces of ſilver to <hi>Judas,</hi> though it was not their intention he ſhould thereby be redeemed, for they ſacrificed him when they had done; that he is the firſt borne, See <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>And ſhe,</hi> meaning <hi>Mary, brought forth her firſt-borne ſon, and wraped him in ſwadling cloaths.</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>To be the firſt-born among many brethren: is thus to be conformable</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:93651:132"/> 
                     <hi>to the image of his Son.</hi> And <hi>Col</hi> 1. 15. 18. it is very clear, by him we have redemption, the forgiveneſs of ſin, who is the image of the inviſible God, (as ſons are of their fathers) the firſt born of every creature; and he is before all things, and he is the head of the body, the Chirch, who is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the firſt-borne from the dead, that in all things he might have the preheminence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The High Prieſt was to marry a virgin, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21. 13, 14, 15. <hi>He ſhall take a wife in her virginity; a widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, theſe ſhall he not take: but he ſhall take a virgin of his own people to wife. Neither ſhall he prophane his ſeed among his people; for I the Lord do ſanctifie him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt is <hi>High Prieſt;</hi> one who deſires your pure love; his Spouſe muſt be bethrothed ſingly in the virginity or purity of the heart (for virginity is purities embleme) and he will either marry and bethroth His clean, unſpotted, and undefiled, or he will make them ſo: But though Chriſt did not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill this particular in the literal ſenſe, yet he doth in a myſtical and ſpiritual: and though Chriſt did not marry a virgin, for he lived a caelibate life, yet he was a <hi>high</hi> Prieſt in a more eminent manner; He was born of a virgin, when they were not ſo; the <hi>high</hi> Prieſts ſons who ſucceeded in that office, were to be born of her who was a virgin immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before. She was wife to their father; for they were the firſt that came off her body after virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now Chriſt had the preheminence here, his mother was a virgin after his birth, as well as at her Eſpouſals.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:93651:132"/> 3. The <hi>High Prieſt</hi> was to be one of the ſons of the pople of humane ſtock; for this was a Statute both for Kings and Prieſts among the children of God. For <hi>Kings,</hi> Deut. 17. 15. <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him King over thee, whom the Lord thy Ged ſhall chuſe; one from among thy brethren ſhalt thou ſet King over thee: thou mayſt not ſet a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger over thee which is not thy brother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Prieſts, they alſo ſhould be ſuch as were deſcended from the Patriarck <hi>Levi. Lev.</hi> 22. 24, 25. <hi>You ſhall not offer unto the Lord that which is bruiſed, or cruſhed, or broken, or cut, neither ſhall ye make any offering thereof in your land:</hi> that was the qualification of the ſacrifice, and it follows in the 25 <hi>verſe, Neither form a ſtrangers hand ſhalt thou offer the bread of your God, becauſe corruption is in them, and blemiſhes in them:</hi> this was the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt was born of a woman, and became like unto us, ſin only accepted. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 16, 17. <hi>Foraſmuch as the Children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame; for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of</hi> Abraham.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The High Prieſt was to look that the wayes to the Cities of <hi>Refuge</hi> were ſo levelled, that the Malefactor might eſcape the hand of the Avenget of blood.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt had his Harbinger before him utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his voice: <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight;</hi> removing the ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks, that Chriſtians might not be hindred in running the way of ſalvation: and as that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93651:133"/> was an intimation of the mercy that ſhould be in the High Prieſt, we find it fully apparent in Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>That he might be a mercifull and a faithful High Prieſt, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people; for in that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is alſo able to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>High Prieſt</hi> was born to this dignity, he was not choſen, neither did he make himſelf by power or policy. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>No man taketh this honour to himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt is <hi>High Prieſt</hi> born, the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God, not taking this dignity to himſelf, but it was given. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 5. So Chriſt alſo glorified not himſelf to be made an <hi>High Priest;</hi> but he that ſaid to him, <hi>Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>High Prieſt</hi> was to have to do with things which belonged to God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 1. For every <hi>High</hi> Prieſt taken from among men, is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and ſacrifices for ſins.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt is <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> who hath to do with the things of God, or divine ſervice, in that foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>A faithful and merciful in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people:</hi> and the higher Chriſt aſcended, the more divine was his ſervice. He who is in heaven, is not now ſo much imployed in raiſing the dead, in feeding the hungry, in letting out vineyards, in curing the deaf, blind, lame, lunatick, leproſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in more divine ſervices, in heavenly works, divine
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93651:133"/> gifts, inward impulſes, ſecret whiſperings, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the hidden Mannah of the Kingdome, the Myſteries and the Oracles of God, broken hearts, melted ſouls, holy tempers, quiet ſpirits, ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive frames, inward reliſhes of divine joy; ſuch things as have a tendency to purifie the conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>High Prieſts</hi> were to intercede for the people. Thus Chriſt is high Prieſt at the Fathers right hand, interceding for the ſins of the people: This was propheſied of him: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. It is fulfilled in the Goſpel: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. 34. <hi>It is Chriſt that dyed,</hi> nay rather, <hi>that is riſen, and maketh interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come unto him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us;</hi> But of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The <hi>High Prieſt</hi> was to regulate the worſhip, and had the management of the Covenant, and had power to agitate affairs between God and man. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Phineas the ſon of Eleazar, the ſon of Aaron the Prieſt, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Iſrael, while he was zealous for my ſake among them, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed not the Children of Iſrael in my jealouſie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore behold, I give unto him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y Covenant of peace, and he ſhall have it, and his ſeed after him, even the Covenant of an everlaſting Prieſthood, becauſe he was zealous for his God, and made an attonement for the Children of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt is <hi>high Prieſt</hi> for ever, and hath the Covenant writ on the tables of his breaſt, who is the infallible word of truth, and who alone is able
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93651:134"/> to direct how the Father will be worſhipped. <hi>John</hi> 4. 21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Jeſus ſaith, Believe me, the hour cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jeruſalem worſhip the Father; the hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth; for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him. God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth;</hi> And the woman could immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that the Meſſias would come, and ſhew them this, and all things elſe, not knowing it to be Chriſt who ſpake to her.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The <hi>High</hi> Prieſt was the Chief in that great Councel in their Sanhedrim. The chief Prieſts and Elders were the men that were ſo often called, and gathered together to determine concerning Chriſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. 3. <hi>Then aſſembled the chief Prieſts, and the Scribes, and the Elders of the people into the palace of the high Prieſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, that they might by ſubtilty take Jeſus and kill him; So when they had apprehended Chriſt, they led him away to Caiaphas the high Prieſt.</hi> Mat. 26. 57. <hi>The high Prieſt had authority of approving of the Prophets, or diſapproving.</hi> Deut. 18. The <hi>High</hi> Prieſt and the Councel had power to ſave or to deſtroy; the power was radicated in them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt upbraids <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for the death of the Prophets, for there the great Councel or Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim ſit in Chriſts time. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 33. For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that a Prophet periſh out of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And when Jeſus foretold his death, he tells it muſt be in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Mat. 16. 21. <hi>Nevertheleſs I muſt go to Jeruſalem and ſuffer many things of the Elders and</hi>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:93651:134"/> 
                     <hi>chief Prieſts, and be killed,</hi> &amp;c. for they had power to take away life; and though they tell <hi>Pilate</hi> when he bad them judge him according to their Law, that it was not lawfull for them to put any man to death; yet this muſt be underſtood, that they would not crucifie any man; and thence it follows, <hi>verſe</hi> 32. <hi>That the ſaying of Jeſus might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, ſignifying what death he ſhould die;</hi> as though the Jews could not put to death any other way, but by crucifixion; but I rather think, that it was ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd that all the people held him as a Prophet, and therefore they durſt not lay hands on him, much leſs kill him. <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 19. and 2. 2. Thus when the Apoſtles were impriſoned, they were brought out without violence, for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains feared the people, leſt they ſhould have been ſtoned. Iniquity was got to that height, that though the Synhedrim had power and authority to put to <hi>death,</hi> yet they durſt not, becauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould then loſe their liberty of tranſgreſſing.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt is <hi>high</hi> Prieſt, who hath all judgement given into his hand; and whomſoever he will, he ſaveth; and whomſoever he will, he deſtroyeth. <hi>John</hi> 5. 22. <hi>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son.</hi> And verſe 25, 26, 27. <hi>For as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf, and hath given him authority to execute judgement alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man;</hi> Nay, he hath not only power to kill, or to ſave the body, but after that, hath power to caſt both body and ſoul into hell fire; whom to diſown and reject, is condemnation; and whom to know, is life eternal.</p>

The <hi>High</hi> Prieſt clenſed the Lepers; by which diſeaſe was typified the grand myſtery of the Goſpel, to wit, <hi>Chriſts coming into the world to take away ſin:</hi> And here I ſhall a little more inlarge my ſelf, that the meaneſt capacity may underſtand how his ſoul may be cured. And what was the end why Chriſt was manifeſted to the world?

                  <p n="1">1. The defilement; here conſider theſe things, which all are not without their ſignification.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All Leproſies were of a defiling nature; they rendred the party that had them <hi>unclean:</hi> and more unclean then rhe touching of any unclean thing. Whoſoever touched a Worm, a Weaſel, a Tortiſe, a Camelion, a Lyzard, a Snail, or a Mole, he ſhould be unclean, but then theſe things might be dead. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 31. <hi>But the Leproſie was of a defiling nature, and the Leper defiled all that touched him, though he was alive.</hi> Lev. 13. 44. <hi>He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the Prieſt ſhall pronunce him ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unclean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ordinary things defiled but for a day, <hi>They that touched a dead carcaſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were to be unclean un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til</hi>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:93651:135"/> 
                     <hi>the evening;</hi> yet we meet, <hi>That whoſoever touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the dead carcaſe of a man, was to be unclean for a week;</hi> yet never did any thing but a Leproſie make man unclean for ever, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as long as he lived.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Leprous mans perſon was not only defiled, but whatſoever he touched was unclean. <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 22. <hi>Whatſoever the unclean perſon toucheth ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean:</hi> Thus ſin defiles not only our perſon, but there is a defilement goeth along with all our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances and duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all our abomination.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Such was the defilement of the Leproſie, that the Leper was excluded from the Congregation. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Command the Children of Iſrael that they put out of the Camp every Leper, and every one that hath an iſſue, and whoſoever is defiled by the dead:</hi> Thus ſin, that deep Leproſie, excludes either out of the Congregation, or out of heaven, or out of both. Oh, it is dangerous to admit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane to the participation of holy things! they are to be pronounced as againſt <hi>unclean,</hi> Lev. 13. 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider the nature of the clenſing. 1. It was to be done by the touch of the <hi>high Prieſt:</hi> it was the Prieſt only that could pronounce <hi>clean,</hi> Levit. 13, 13. 37, 59. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 48. <hi>Both houſe and perſon muſt be clenſed by the Prieſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt muſt be he that clenſeth ſinners: there is no name under heaven given, by which we can be ſaved, but by the name of Jeſus Chriſt. 2. It was not ordinary that the Leprous were healed of their ſores, but thoſe abode as long as they lived; therefore when Chriſt did not only clenſe the Leper but heal him, the Jews looked upon it as a Miracle, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 13. <hi>There was not only a making clean, but</hi>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:93651:136"/> 
                     <hi>a making whole;</hi> ſee it expreſly ſet down. <hi>The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie departed from them whom Chriſt clenſed;</hi> but not ſo with thoſe that the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of the Jewes clenſed. 3. Notwithſtanding the ſcars and ſores remained; yet after the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> had pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them clean, they were all admitted again into the Congregation. Thus <hi>Gehazi</hi> was condemned to a perpetual leproſie, a leproſie for ever; yet we find that after this denouncing the leproſie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſs upon him, he had converſe with the King. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 4. 5. <hi>When he was pronounced clean, then he might come into the Congregation, though he was never healed from his ſores.</hi> Thus Chriſt may by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification pronounce, That the guilt ſhall not be imputed, though the filth be not wholly taken away by ſanctification as long as a man liveth. 3. Conſider the qualification of the perſons that were to be clenſed, and that was, they ſhould be all over ſores, wholy defiled, &amp; then ſhould they be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>clean. Lev.</hi> 13. 12, 13. <hi>And if a Leproſie break out abroad in the skin, and cover all the skin of him that hath the plague, from the head even to the foot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Prieſt looketh, then the Prieſt ſhall conſider, and behold, if the Leproſie have covered all his fleſh, he ſhall pronounce him clean that hath the plague; it is turned white, he is clean.</hi> A ſtrange Law, then to be pronounced clean, when the defilement hath wholy overſpread the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt, thoſe whom he leaves, muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg their caſe deſperate; thoſe whom he heals, muſt confeſs themſelves to be very ſick; the ſinner muſt acknowledge himſelf ſinful, before he look after a Saviour, or before Chriſt will come down to ſave him.</p>

                     <p n="1">I. <hi>That Chriſt came to take away ſin,</hi> Eph. 5. 2, <hi>Walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us an offering and a ſacrifice to God, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> Thus Gal. 3. 13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> This is proved alſo, 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> This <hi>John</hi> teſtifies at the firſt ſight of Chriſt; John 1. 29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi> It would be no hard task for me to multiply Texts of Scripture to prove this: but I ſhall wave that, and lay down only theſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:93651:137"/> two relations of Chriſt which he came in; both which witneſs in their own natural acceptation that this was his end in deſcending from the Father.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In as much as he became our ſurety: which Office is apparent to evety conſiderate eye, that its tendency is to quit and ſet free the party bound and under obligation. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 20, 21, 22. And in as much as not without an oath he was made a Prieſt; others were made or conſecrated Prieſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an oath; but of him the Lord ſwore, and would not repent, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedeck;</hi> by ſo much was Jeſus made a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a better Teſtament: and upon this account was it that he had a body prepared, namely that he might pay the debt which the ſinners could not do; and upon this account was it that he was made under the Law; for men that are Sureties, before they enter into bond, are free from Law; but after, have the debt of the Debtor laid to their charge: Thus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. In as much as he became our Advocate: which Office alſo denotes taking away of guilt. Advocate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are in order, and exerciſed about the juſtification of their Clients: and Chriſt is thus our Advocate, who pleads for us; as our Surety he offered Eſtate for Eſtate, body for body, goods for goods, life for life: ſo a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus it follows, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Having ſuch a Prieſt-hood, he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him; ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to plead, or to advocate for us.</hi>

                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:93651:138"/> 2. Now in the ſecond place let us conſider, <hi>What it is in ſin that Chriſt takes away, and how he doth it:</hi> and here conſider theſe things which Chriſt takes away, and then he leaves but little behind.</p>
                     <p>1. The guilt of ſin. 2. The filth or ſtain. 3. The power and dominion. 4. The ſad and undoing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſin: all which Chriſt the High Prieſt takes away in believers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The guilt of ſin is taken away by Chriſt, which doth comprehend theſe things in it, which I ſhall ſpeak to in particular.</p>
                     <p>1. Imputation. 2. Debt. 3. Obnoxiouſneſs. 4. Mortality; which four things when I have ſhewn that Chriſt takes away, there will remain nothing in the nature of guilt, but it will be removed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 To the making up of guilt, there is required imputation; and untill this, there can be no ſenſe of the guilt of ſin, untill ſin be laid to the charge of the ſoul; and untill the ſpirit convinces us, and makes conſcience point at us, and ſay, we are the men, and women, there wiil be no ſenſe of ſin; the ſoul is not apprehenſive of offending, untill the offence be imputed, and particularly applyed. Thus we find as ſoon as the ſenſe of <hi>Sauls</hi> carriage was charged home upon his conſcience, and he found a witneſs in himſelf, telling him that <hi>David</hi> had not done ſo with him, then he lift up his voice, and wept, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17. 18. Thus when the ſinner can
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93651:138"/> ſay, <hi>Lord, I am the man, I am the Traitor, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> then guilt begins to appear, and that is terrible; this voice when it imputes ſin, it makes the ſtout heart to tremble, as the Law did, and the thunders and lightnings that were heard then; <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 16. For I may ſay by this is the knowledge of ſin, as well as by the Law; ſo we find as ſoon as the ſenſe of ſin was imputed to the Jaylor in his own breaſt, then he called for a light, and ſprang in, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and fell down before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas; Oh then men and brethren what muſt we do to be ſaved! Acts</hi> 16. 29. This is the firſt thing that is implyed in guilt, an imputation of the offence, or an applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Now Chriſt the high Prieſt he takes away this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſin, by taking the fault to himſelf, and ſo laying our iniquities on his own ſhoulders, and bearing our tranſgreſſions in his own perſon; he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges the ſoul of it, and takes their accounts on his ſcore, and ſayes, <hi>Let your ſins be at my peril:</hi> and thus he is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of reconciliation, having quit us from Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and applyed the offence to himſelf; and that this is enough for the removal of imputation, you may learn from the firſt ſin Every one in Paradiſe did but deſire this, that they might remove the imputation from themſelves, and lay it on another, and that they thought would quit them; ſo <hi>Adam</hi> laid it on <hi>Eve</hi> the woman, and <hi>Eve</hi> laid it on the Serpent the Tempter. Now though the conſcience do charge ſin home, and bring into fear and thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and repreſent the Executioner, the ſentence and condemnation; yet the ſoul is really free, where
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93651:139"/> ſin is not imputed to us, but to another. And this Chriſt takes upon him; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. Chirſt was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to bear the ſins of many, and to them that look for him he ſhall appear without ſin. Thus it is clear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 21. <hi>All things are of God who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the Miniſtry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes to them: for he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. In Guilt, or to the eſſence of guilt there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired debt, and this follows upon imputation; for untill imputation, debt is not acknowledged; till debt be acknowledged, the ſinner juſtifies himſelf, and thinks that he is clear from the blood of every man, and no man can lay a farthing to his charge; ſo that he is like the Phariſee, no debtor to the Law, but he hath done all things contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, paid every man his own, faſted twice a week, is no Extortioner, no Murderer, <hi>&amp;c. Luke</hi> 18. 11, 12. But you may ſee in the Publican, as ſoon as he had imputed his ſin to him, he doth not ſtand to juſtifie himſelf, but to plead a Debtor, and beg mercy; he durſt not ſo much as lift up his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but ſmote upon his breaſt, and ſaid, <hi>Lord be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to me a ſinner:</hi> therefore in that implicite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in the Lords Prayer, Chriſt when he teacheth us to ask forgiveneſs, he at the ſame time teaches us to call ſins debts; knowing that none can really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be forgiven, where they think they owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 22. <hi>And forgivt us our debts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:93651:139"/>
                     <p> Now Chriſt our High Prieſt removes this debt, <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligando ſe pro debitis noſtris,</hi> binding his perſon for our treſpaſſes and engagements, by becomming our Surety for us, and entering into bond on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of our ſouls; being made ſin, that we might be made righteous; being the ſacrifice, upon whom the Debt of the Sacrificer was laid; and thus he reſcues us. This therefore was called Grace, as indeed it was; for he paid our debts, though he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no previous obligation to us; nay, though Chriſt knew our poverty, and that we were never able to pay the ſcore of ſin, or to repay him, ſhould he lay down his life for us: and though he knew, in caſe of our inſufficiency, the price would be required of him who was become our Surety; yet he would bind himſelf on our behalfes; Oh this was free grace, to undertake to pay our debts for us, when he was in no debt to us: therefore the Apoſtle magnifies Grace, which bound Chriſt on our behalfes, when we were ſtrangers, nay, enemies to him by wicked works. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is conſiderable in guilt, Obnoxiouſneſs, which follows upon the imputation of the debt: for as ſoon as debt is laid to the charge of the ſoul, and imputed to it, Oh then there is an ingenuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of guiltineſs, which carryes with it the ſence of the breach of the Law, and obnoxiouſneſſe to the Law, or a being liable to the penalty of the Law; and then the ſinner ſees himſelf under threatnings, curſes, condemnation: and if he be not ſtupified then under the ſenſe of his obnoxiouſneſſe, muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther openly reſiſt, and bid defiance to the Lotd of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93651:140"/> hoſts, or elſe he muſt fall down, and cry for mercy, &amp; pardon for the Lords Chriſts ſake. Whilſt a hard heart can evade debt and imputation, he will; but when ſin is laid to his charge, then he becomes a Debtor, and obnoxious, agreeable to the evidence in his own conſcience; and when this is demonſtrated to his face, then he muſt either did defiance to God, or fall down, and implore his grace: thus the brethren of <hi>Joſeph</hi> evaded, being obnoxious as long as they could; but when he came with evidence upon them, and told them, that he could certainly divine, then they ſtood out no more, but cryed, <hi>What ſhall we ſay to my Lord, what ſhall we ſpeak, or how ſhall we clear our ſelves? God hath found out the iniquity of his ſervants; behold we are my Lords ſervants, both we, and he alſo with whom the cup is found,</hi> Gen. 44. 15, 16.</p>
                     <p>Now Chriſt our High Prieſt takes away obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>Perſonam ſuam noſtro loco offerendo,</hi> by putting his perſon into our place: for the Law would not be ſatisfied without blood, for without blood there is no remiſſion; and God having us under engagement, (to ſpeak after the manner of men) ſues his bond; and being we were unable, the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is found liable to the ſame debt: and thus the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity fell upon him, who knew no ſin, becauſe he was engaged with us; here was grace, free grace; and it appeared the more, in as much as the ſtrait was greater into which poor ſouls were brought: thus Chriſt interpoſed as high Prieſt, and not only ſo, but as a ſacrifice; the clean fot the unclean, the juſt for the unjuſt, the righteous for the ſinner, the Creator for the Creature, Cſtriſt for man, nay for
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:93651:140"/> his enemies. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. <hi>When we were yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength, Christ dyed for the ungodly, and herein was Love commended,</hi>

                     <p>And that the Lord of life ſhould undergo death: Oh what love is this! Thus Chriſt entered into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place, not by the blood of Goats, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 9. 12, 13. And that he could not do this without blood, you may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>And almoſt all things are by the Law purged with blood; and without blood there is no remiſſion:</hi> Thus the ſinner ſtands <hi>rectus in curia,</hi> clothed in righteouſneſs, having his debt paid by another: which was ſuch a peice of folly to the heathens,
<q>Per mortem alterius ſtultum eſt speraſſe ſalutem:</q> They counted it folly to expect ſalvation by anothers death: And why might they not count it well folly, to expect the cancelling of the bond, when the Surety had paid the debt?</p>

                     <p n="3">3. There is a power, and a dominion in ſin which Chriſt takes away: which dominion comprehendeth theſe three things; Authority, Intereſt, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; all which Chriſt our High Prieſt takes away.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is Authority in the dominion of ſin; not only a <hi>potentia,</hi> but a <hi>potest as;</hi> not only power in ſins commands, but alſo authority; ſin comming into the world now pleads cuſtome; it is not in us only as a tyrant uſurping authority, but it is in the ſinner as King, as lawfull magiſtrate, in whoſe commands the ſoul doth acquieſce; thus ſin hath a right over us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we were borne under this government, heirs of wrath, under the power of thoſe parents who were under this government, and therefore we are under it; and ſeeing this right and ſupremacy of ſin is derived to it by our birth, it is unqueſtionable; but if this be ſcrupled, there is another ground, and that is becauſe we have yeilded our ſelves ſins volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſervants; and this bequeathing of our ſelves to the ſervice of ſin, the Apoſtle calls a being ſold under ſin: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. now where there is a ſale, the right is conveyed to another; <hi>quod venditur, tranſit in poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem alterius;</hi> we are now ſins which hath bought us, or we are ſins ſervants and ſlaves, becauſe we have yeilded our ſelves; for know ye not, that to whom ye yeeld your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93651:145"/> ye are whom ye obey, whether of ſin unto death, or of righteouſneſſe unto eternall life? thus death hath a right to all ſinners, and ſin hath a right to all naturall men.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the ſale of our ſelves, there follows an intereſt that ſin hath to us and in us: for as I ſaid, <hi>quicquid venditur,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p n="1">1. He takes away the Authority, right and claime which ſin makes to us, in as much as he hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened by purchaſing us of the Father, ſo that his right (I mean as to the new borne and regenerate) ſuperſedes ſins right; For though ſin was mans lord, in reſpect of man himſelf who had offered voluntary obedience; yet in reſpect of God, ſin was but mans Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and God hath not loſt his right in us, though we had made defection ftom him, and caſt off obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him; and Satan made forfeiture of his right, in as much as he went beyond his limits, and laid claime to Chriſt, in whom he found nothing of his, ſo he loſt right to man; but though there had not been ſuch a purchaſe, yet the Father gave Chriſt many ſoules when he came into the world, and thoſe he reſcued, and redeemed, and over thoſe he hath a right, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 6. and <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 28. it is clear that Chriſt hath bought or purchaſed the Church of God with his own blood, ſo that this purchaſe being of latter date then Satans, and being of him that had right to ſell, the right goes out which ſin can claime, and it devolves into Chriſt, whoſe we now are, bought with a price.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the purchaſe and gift, follows an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:93651:146"/> which Chriſt hath in his; thus it is with Chriſtians under the Goſpel, thoſe whom the Father hath given to the Son, as it was with the <hi>Jewes</hi> under the Law; they were to be holy to the Lord; for he had ſevered them from among other people, that they ſhould be his, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. 26.

                     <p n="3">3. From this right and intereſt which Chriſt hath in man, man becomes ſubject to Chriſt, that high Prieſt: ſo that here you may ſee ſins dominion falls to the ground; for if the ſoul be ſubject to Chriſt, it cannot be ſubject to Satan; for their Laws are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to another: one cannot obey God and Mammon. But here is one thing more that Chriſt doth to the overthrowing of the kingdom of ſin:
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:93651:146"/> for rhough he have now a right and intereſt, and the ſinner in his mind and inward man become ſubject to Chriſt; yet Satan he keeps poſſeſſion, and will abide a wraſtle, a combate, a duel before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh. The ſtrong man hath the hold; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a ſtronger then he come, though his title be bad, yet he will not give up his place, ſo that Chriſt comes by ſtrong hand, and caſts him out. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>For as much then as Children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, and ſo deliver them that were under bondage:</hi> Therefore as death and ſin have had their reign, their authority and power, ſo Chriſt will have his: and this you may ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14, 17, 21. <hi>As by diſobedience of one many were made ſinners, and ſin paſſed upon all, and raigned over all, as to condemnation; ſo by the obedience of one, and righteouſneſs of Chriſt, ſhall many be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>By the obedience of one,</hi> that is, by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the manner of his obedience, as well as having his obedience imputed to us: and thus we are looſed from the ſlaviſh obedience to ſin; and this is the tranſlating into the liberty and freedom of the children of God: for the ſervice of Chriſt is perfect freedom; and this is the ſtate of grace, not to be under the Law, whoſe commands are mortal and deadly, as ſins Laws are; not under Laws, the obedience to which procures death and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but under Laws, the obedience to which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures eternal life; and though Chriſt have not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away this Law of ſin in the members, ye he hath enſlaved it, and brought it under ſubject it
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:93651:147"/> on: ſo that ſin in the Children of God is not as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> a chief Maſter-Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, as it is in the wicked; nor one in obedience to whoſe Laws they take any delight; but as the <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites</hi> were hewers of wood and drawers of water: ſin ſerves for good and bleſſed purpoſes, that grace may be the more viſible; and though it be in the ſoul, yet it hath not predominancy. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9, 13, 14, 17, 18 <hi>Death ſhall have no more dominion over them; and yield not your Members inſtruments of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For ſin ſhall have no more dominion over you; for you are not under the</hi> Law, <hi>but under</hi> Grace. <hi>For you have obeyed from the heart that form of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which was delivered to you; for being made free from ſin, ye became the ſervants of righteouſneſs.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. Chriſt our high Prieſt takes away the ſad and undoing effects or conſequences of ſin; and this is that which makes ſin ſo dreadfull: hell would not be terrible, but that it torments us; fire would not be dreadfull, but that it burns and conſumes: now there are ſad dangerous conſequences of ſin that makes it ſo formidable; <hi>Tremebundus aggredior:</hi> I cannot but ſigh to think, much more to ſpeak of them: but I ſhall but name them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p>Now Chriſt our high Prieſt takes away this curſe, by being made a curſe for us: it is ſo plain, that I need not ſpeak more to it, then only mention it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us; as it is written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree:</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Another conſequence of ſin, is, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of death, and being in ſlavery to the fear of death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>As by one man ſin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the world; ſo death by ſin;</hi> and thus death paſſed upon all men, in as much as all have ſinned: thus poor tranſgreſſors that look on their offence, muſt needs alſo ſee the curſe approaching, and death ready to overtake them.

And as there is a neceſſary connexion between work and wages, ſo there is between ſin and death: and as thoſe who have conceived, muſt bring forth or miſcarry, which is worſe; ſo thoſe that ſin, ſhall ſurely die. <hi>James</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Then when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin; and when ſin is finiſhed, it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now Chriſt our high Prieſt takes away this power of death, and the fear of death: having aboliſhed death, and brought life and immortality to light through the goſpel. Indeed death did raign before Chriſt, but he hath brought it under ſubjection, and hath made ſins conception abortive; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57. Chriſt hath let us ſee, that we may ſo carry our ſelves in conformity to him, that corruption ſhall put on incorruption, &amp; morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity put on immortality; and then death ſhall be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in victory; for where the body is immortal,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:93651:148"/> as after the reſurrection it ſhall be, there will be no place for death; and therefore the Apoſtle tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting!</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thanks be to God which giveth us victory through our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ:</hi> And well may the ſoul triumph, when death hath loſt its ſting, and the Law its ſentence, and ſin its power, and the body its mortality. Thus we ſee <hi>Hebrews</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>That Chriſt delivers us who through fear of death are all our life time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to bondage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another conſequence of ſin, is, the Fathers wrath; and this is a burden that no ingenuous child can be under, and be at reſt: And this we find to be the ſad accent of the aggravation of the Prodigals ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 18. <hi>I have ſinned againſt heaven;</hi> but that was not all; he had ſinned againſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and provoked his father, and forfeited his ſonne-ſhip; Oh this wounded him, <hi>I have ſinned againſt thee, O Father, and am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called thy ſonne!</hi> To this purpoſe I have met with a paſſage of a learned <hi>Rabbi Jochanan,</hi> who is ſuppoſed to be that <hi>John, Acts.</hi> 4 6. When he began to be ſick, and felt himſelf languiſh, and grow near his death, his Diſciples or his Schollars came to him: whom aſſoon as he ſaw, he began to weep; they looking upon him as an holy man, began to comfort him in theſe words; <hi>O Lucerna Iſraelis! O columna Domini, unde istae lachrymae?</hi> O thou Light of <hi>Iſrael!</hi> O thou Pillar of the houſe of God! whence are theſe tears, and wherefore? to whom he anſwered; <hi>Si me adducturi eſſent coram Rege carnis &amp; ſanguinis;</hi> if they were about to carry me before the Kings of the earth, the Kings that are but fleſh
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93651:149"/> and blood, who to day are, and to morrow in the grave; though he ſhould be angry with me, <hi>Ira ejus non eſt aeterna,</hi> his anger is not eternal; though he ſhould caſt me into priſon, <hi>Vincula ejus non ſunt aeterna,</hi> his bondage is not eternal; and if he ſhould ſentence me to death, and kill me, yet his death is not eternal; and poſſibly I might pacifie his wrath with good words or gifts: But they are about to carry me before the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, that is from everlaſting to everlaſting; and if he be angry with me, <hi>Ira ejus eſt aeterna, vincula aeterna, occiſio aeterna;</hi> his anger will be eternal; if he caſt me into priſon, his bonds are eternal; if he kill me, his death is eternal; whom I can pacifie <hi>Neque prece, neque precio,</hi> neither with prayer and entreaty, nor with Bribe or Preſent: and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more there are two wayes before me; one to Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, the other to hell; and I know not whither of them they will lead me; <hi>Nonne igitur flerem?</hi> ſhall I then refrain mine eyes from tears? This was the ſenſe that thoſe of old had of the wrath of God; and indeed if it be once kindled, who can abide it? The Concomitants of which wrath you may ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 31, 32. <hi>I will pour out my indignation upon thee, I will blow againſt thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of the brutiſh men, and skilfull to deſtroy; thou ſhalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood ſhall be in the midſt of the land, thou ſhalt be no more remembred, for I the Lord have ſpoken it;</hi> thus is the wrath of God a conſequent of ſin.</p>
                     <p>Now Chriſt our high Prieſt takes away this; he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93651:149"/> the Fathers wrath by interpoſing and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Peace-offering. So that though our ſins be upon Chriſt, yet we ſee the teſtimony of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, <hi>That Chriſt is his beloved Son, in whom he is well pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3. And thus the Apoſtle infers our acceptance; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Our acceptance is in the beloved, in whom we have redemption through his blood.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks have a ceremony that doth illuſtrate this, and make it very plain, to wit, their <hi>Agni Dei;</hi> Certain Wafers of wax in the form of a lamb, mixt with holy water, which they give unto the people; and amongſt other things, that theſe Wafers are uſefull for, they are good for this; <hi>Quod a fulgore &amp; tempeſtate fideles &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes defendunt propter virtutem benedictionis &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrationis,</hi> that they defend the faithfull and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever from Tempeſts, Thunders and Lightnings (which are Emblems of Gods wrath in Scripture) by the vettue of their ſanctity given to them at their conſecration; and if Conſecraters add vertue, Chriſt was conſecrated for evermore, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 28. And that this wrath is taken away, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8, 9. <hi>For if Chriſt dyed when we were yet ſinners; much more being juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi> So 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Even Jeſus which delivered us from the wrath to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another conſequence of ſin, is, an aptitude and proneſs to ſin, which comes from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin; <hi>Peccando diſcas peccare;</hi> frequent repetitions make an action facile and eaſie, and ſo grow into an habit; and this is the method that Satan uſes in tempting; <hi>A minori ad majus;</hi> firſt
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93651:150"/> creep, and then go; <hi>Leviora ſolent eſſe haereſium, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viora facinorum initia;</hi> firſt <hi>Peter</hi> only denyes, then he proceeds to back it with an oath, to curſe and ſwear, that he knows not Chriſt: Firſt diſpoſitions, then habits; thus ſin grows from the bud into the ſtalk, then to the bloſſome, then the fruit: ſo that ſin grows natural to the fleſh; ſo that the ſoul may doubt as <hi>David</hi> did of <hi>Saul, I ſhall one day dye by the hand of Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 31. Firſt ſin appears modeſt; but after familiarity, it grows impudent, and then it claſms authority and right, and ſo ſets up an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or a kingdome croſsing the kingdom of grace, and at length comes to be a Law.</p>
                     <p>Now this Chriſt our high Prieſt takes away by working us to a conformity by degrees, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up another Law in the mind that reſiſteth the Law in the members: for as <hi>Nemo repente fit tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſſimus,</hi> no man is deſperately wicked at the firſt motion; ſo no man gets to the top of piety at the firſt ſtep, but by degrees. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21, 22. When the Apoſtle had complained of his body of death, he preſently thanks God through Chriſt, as taking away that proneſs and propenſity in the fleſh by the minds conqueſt over it. Now as the diſpoſition to ſin by frequent reiterating grows into a habit; ſo doth grace; the way which was tedious, and in which the feet of the ſoul were not uſed to tread, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten walking becomes delightſome; and the yoke by often drawing in it, becomes eaſie, and the burden light.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There is another conſequent in ſin, and that
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93651:150"/> is bondage, ſlavery, thraldome; in which bondage theſe things are conſiderable.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In bondage there is a ſubjection; that <hi>Agar</hi> the mother of bondſlaves, and the type of her poſterity, was a ſervant under command, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 22. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a bondwoman.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe in bondage have no title to the priviledges of ſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They have no title to the priviledges of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe; therefore ſaith <hi>Sarah,</hi> Caſt out the bondwoman and her ſon, <hi>Ger.</hi> 21. 10. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 30. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe in bondage have not right to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as ſons have; ſo it follows with <hi>Sarah, Caſt out the bondwomman and her ſon, for ſhe ſhall not inherit with my ſon,</hi> Gal. 4. 30. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 10.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In bondage there is this conſiderable, to wit a handwriting, or ſome Indenture as in binding Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices or, booking them, as the cuſtome is at ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes in hireing ſervants; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the articles in writing.</p>
                     <p>Now Chriſt our High Prieſt takes away all theſe; when the High Prieſt dyed, it was a year of libery to all captives and bondmen; and ſo it is in Chriſts death; for by this we are both made free from ſin, <hi>and become the ſervants of righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 6. 18. and the Apoſtle. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 22. tells us plainly, that
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93651:151"/> the Lords ſervants are all freemen: and as to the right of ſons, this Chriſt intitles us in, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 10. 11. <hi>That all might be gathered together in one in Chriſt. In whom we have obtained the inheritance of ſons;</hi> Thoſe that were bondmen, not having any thing to do, no not ſo much as to take his name into their mouths, now made ſons, and adopted, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the priviledges of ſons; thus 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and father of our Lord Jeſus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotton us again unto a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead; To an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, reſerved for us in the heavens.</hi> That inheritance to which we could claime no right by our firſt birth, he hath begot us again, and of bondmen made us free, of baſtards ſons, and ſo the inheritance is ours; and as for the handwriting which tyed us to this bondage, that he alſo takes away; <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13, 14. and being dead in your ſins and the uncircumciſion of the fleſh, he hath quickned you together with him, having forgiven you all treſpaſſes, blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances which was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his croſſe; here are the phraſes that do witneſſe the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling of this bond, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> blotting it out; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, he took it from amongſt us, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, he faſtned it to his croſſe, in publique view; thus we may find at large the manner of the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the malefactor at liberty which will give great light to the way and manner how Chriſt ſets ſinners at liberty from this bondage, and ſlavery and fear; when any one had done any evil that ſhould cauſe the avenger of blood to follow him, he would
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93651:151"/> flee to a City of refuge, and the congregation ſhould judge between the ſlayer and avenger of blood, and they ſhould reſtore him to the City of refuge whether he fled, untill the death of the High Prieſt; but if the ſlayer ſhould at any time, between his offence and the death of the High Prieſt, come out of the City into the borders, he ſhould be liable to death (Chriſt is the alone rock, out of whom there is no ſafety) but at the death of the High Prieſt, the malefactor ſhould be reſtored to his poſſeſſions again, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 25, 26, 27, 28. thus we find untill Chriſts death ſin raigned in the world, but he hath now put it under his feet; and while men are under the law of works, though they can ſometimes flye to their integrity to ſave them, yet every ſmal ſin is as a comming out of the City in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the borders, and then they are liable again to the avenger of blood; but it is not ſo with thoſe that come to Chriſt; ſin doth not make them diſmaid: if we ſin we have an advocate with the father; every ſin doth not enſlave; thus you ſee the reſemblance between the High Prieſt and Chriſt, which was the firſt thing I propounded, in this office.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us alſo conſider the tranſcendency of the office of Chriſt, and the perſon of Chriſt, to this Jewiſh High Prieſt, and ſo we may be more fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his power and efficacy in taking away ſin, which was the great errand why Chriſt came into the world, as atonment was the ſpeciall imployment of the High Prieſt; we are but too apt to judge things according to their outward appearance; and thence it is that many think ſo lowly of Chriſt; they thought him ſmitten of God, and that there was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:93651:152"/> in him, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. 2. and indeed none can paſſe other ſentence, if they look only at the ſhell, the fleſh; but look at his Archangelicall ſoul, and you ſhall find that his nature is according to his works all myſterious, and his worth according to his birth, all glorious within; the glory of the High Prieſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, was in externalls, in garments and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſs waſhings, <hi>&amp;c.

                     <p n="1">1. Chriſt our High Prieſt is more excellent, or tranſcends the High Prieſts of the Law, in his uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or anointing; <hi>Aarons</hi> annoynting oile was but made of principal ſpices at the beſt, Mirrh, ſweet Cinamon, ſweet <hi>Calamus, Caſſia,</hi> and <hi>Oile Olive;</hi> thoſe were the ingredients; but when the Lord comes to anoint his ſon, he doth it more ſolemnly and with majeſty. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 19, 20. <hi>I have exalted one from among the people, and have laid help on one that mighty,</hi> and with holy oile have I anointed him; which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where is called the oile of gladneſſe; and what this is, you may ſee, <hi>Act:</hi> 10. 38. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p n="2">2. The Prieſt after the order of <hi>Aaron</hi> was but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed ordinarily to one office; but Chriſt was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed to all the three offices of King, Prophet, and Prieſt. <hi>Aaron</hi> was anointed Prieſt, <hi>Saul</hi> anointed King, <hi>Eliſha</hi> anointed prophet, <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> King and Prieſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> Prieſt and Prophet, <hi>David</hi> King and Prophet, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> was King, Prieſt and Prophet, and he is ſaid to be after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> but he was the perfecteſt of that order; he exceeded <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> himſelf; not only King of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the but prophet and light of the world, and the Prieſt of the moſt high God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The garments of the High Prieſt were of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible materials; they were earthly and after the faſhion of this world, ſuch as moths could corrupt, or thieves break through and ſteal, but Chriſt was not ſo arrayed, but he was cloathed with majeſty, with beauty; with Glory as with a garment; nay ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 16. <hi>He was cloathed with ſalvation,</hi> a garment that never was worne by man before; <hi>He was cloathed in a veſture dipt in blood</hi> (or in red apparel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 2.) <hi>and his name was called the word of God,</hi> Rev. 19. 13.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The High Prieſt was to be without bodily blemiſh, which you may ſee clearly ſet forth, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Whatſoever man he be that hath a blemiſh, he ſhall not approach to offer the food or the bread of God; he who is blind or lame, or hath a flat noſe, or any thing ſuperfluous or broken-footed,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:93651:153"/> or broken-handed, or crooke-backt, or a dwarf, or hath a blemiſh in his eye, or the ſcurvie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſhall not come nigh to offer the offering made by fire, he ſhall not go into the vaile, nor approach the altar, becauſe he hath a blemiſh, that he profane not my ſanctuary; for I the Lord do ſanctifie them; now Chriſt he was not only without bodily blemiſh, but without ſoul blemiſh; &amp; ſo ought thoſe to be who are imployed in the ſame worke (ſcandalous Prieſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane the holy thing they teach.) That he was ſo holy, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. <hi>For ſuch an High Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, made higher then the heavens.

                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The High Prieſt in his atonement, uſed to take two goates, one whereof was ſacrificed, the other was to eſcape, and carry the ſins of the people into the wilderneſſe, to be forgotten; now Chriſt he excelled here, in taking two natures, corporeal and ſpiritual, body and ſoul; the firſt was ſacrificed, the other not mortal, neither corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The ſacrifices of the Jewiſh High Prieſts were but the blood of bulls and goats, and the aſhes of an heifer; but Chriſt tranſcended here and made uſe of his own blood, his own life; neither by the blood of bulls and goats, and calves but by his own blood
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93651:153"/> he entered once into the holy place, having obtained eternall redemption for us, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 9. 12.</p>

The atonement of the Legall High Prieſt was but from year to year, and ſo was often reiterated, which ſhewed that the people once cleanſed might returne to their vomit, and to their wallowing in the mire, or that there were failings in their atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it was not ſo with Chriſt; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 25, 26. Nor yet that he ſhould offer himſelf often, as the High Prieſt went into the holy place; but now once in the end of the world, hath he apeared to put away ſin, by the ſacrifice of himſelf, and thus <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. by the which will we are ſanctified through the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all; he did not his work of redemption ſo imperfectly, that it ſhould need a ſecond edition; and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>For the High Prieſt of the Law ſtands dayly miniſtring, offering the ſame offering oftentimes, which can never take away ſins.

                     <p n="10">10. The High Prieſt went once a year into the holy of holyes, and there atoned, and this was their higheſt perfection; but this holy of holyes was but a place made with hands, it was a meterial tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but Chrſt our evangelical High Prieſt being come an High Prieſt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to ſay, not of this building; not by the blood, of bulls, &amp; goats but by his own blood he entred in once into the holy place, and there he ſitteth at the right hand of God, expecting when his enemies ſhall be made his footſtoole.</p>

The ſacrifices of the High Prieſts under the Law, were but to the purifyng of the fleſh, but Chriſt went further, even to the purifying of the heart; ſo the Jews did interpret the Law, to have reſpect only to outward actions, ſo that their ſacrifices clenſed but the outward man; and this you may ſee Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them for, when he came to put the right gloſs and interpretation on the word of the Lord and the letter of the Law; they waſh the outſide of the cup and the platter, but within they are full of extortion and exceſſe; <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 25. and thus in tithing their mint and aniſe and cummin, but neglecting the more weighty things of the Law; So that he reſpects the purification of the heart; That was the thing he came to ſanctifie, that was the veſſel he would have kept clean; ſee to this purpoſe <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 14. For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the aſhes of an heifer ſprinckling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal ſpirit offered himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot of God, purge your conſciences from dead workes to ſerve the living God! and for this cauſe he is the mediator of the new teſtament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions, that were under the firſt covenant, they which are called, might receive the promiſe of the eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; thus we may ſee Chriſt tranſcending the Jewiſh High Prieſt.</p>

See the Law of redeeming that houſe or land that had been ſold to another. <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. <hi>The poſſeſſion ſhould return to the Owner, but then he muſt redeem it in due time.</hi> Verſe 30. <hi>If a man ſell an houſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he may redeem it within a whole year after it is ſold; but if it be not redeemed within the ſpace of a full year, then the houſe ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations, it ſhall not go out in the</hi> Jubilee.

Doth not thy Chriſt ſtand daily knocking? doth he not ſend word of his approach?

O ſinner! why, then wilt thou not come unto him, that thou mayſt live? or why doſt thou deal ſo perverſly with Chriſt, who came to do thy ſoul good? Wouldſt thou deal ſo with thy friend?

                     <p n="4">4. If Chriſt be our high Prieſt, then Chriſtians ſhould ſuffer Chriſt to regulate their worſhip: The High Prieſt under the Law had the keeping of the Covenant, and the Tables of ſtone, and the power or right of interpreting them. Surely we ought to give Chriſt leave to direct us, if we own him as our Guide, our Prophet: and we will give Chriſt leave to inſtitute for us, if we own him as our Pontifex, our Oracle; we will give Chriſt leave to tell us how the Father will be worſhipped, if we look upon him as our high Prieſt. The chief Prieſt was to give order himſelf about the things of God, the affairs of the Congregation, and the ſenſe of the Law; and about Controverſals, he was alwayes the Chair man, or Moderator, the Speaker of the great Councel or the <hi>Sanhedrim:</hi> and thus is Chriſt, in order to the managing the affairs of the ſanctuary; ſo that they determine without truth, and without proof, who have Chriſts negative voice; and they worſhip they know not what, and they know not how, who worſhip any other way then he hath directed in his Goſpel; and you may ſee how that is, <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>In Spirit and in truth.</hi> If the Jewiſh Pedagogy was then to be demoliſhed, ſurely by this time there ought not ſo much as the ruines of the walls, or the rubbiſh to appear: It is a character of the earthly man, and the fleſhly man, and carnal
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:93651:157"/> heart (who is immerſt in the body, and hath his ſoul transformed according to the ſluggiſh nature of the body) that would only give God the bodily ſervice, and not the ſervice of the mind and ſoul; They fall ſhort of the righteouſneſs of the Goſpel, and come below the pattern of Chriſt, who only tithe Mint and Cummin, when the more weighty things of the Law are neglected: They are Gluttons that would have all the ſervice of God conſiſt in meats and drinks, and painted Sepulchers; who had rather be rotten within, then neglect their divers waſhings; not heeding the lavour of Regeneration, a conſcience purified from dead works to ſerve the Lord withal. Chriſt would rather have his worſhip naked, that its innocency might be ſeen, then have a private weapon carryed under ſome holy garment to wound him with all, when the pretence is only to kiſs him: in this reſpect it may be ſaid of ſome mens worſhip, as it was ſaid of a Tragedy by <hi>Philo,</hi> It was a very good one, if one could have ſeen it for words. Some mens worſhip would be more pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if it were not ſo gawdy; and it will be eaſie to miſtake the Baſtard for the Heir, if Apparrel be all the diſtinction. The Jewiſh ſervice was but to laſt untill the time of reformation, or reſtitution of all things; their meats, and drinks, and waſhings, and carnal Ordinances which were impoſed, were but to abide till the time of reformation, and that was untill Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10, 11. But afterward it ſhould be in the hidden Manna of the heart. I confeſs there may be a wonderfull decency and majeſty too in apparel, which is the hand-maid of the heart; but that ſhe ſhould take place of her
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:93651:158"/> Miſtriſs, is but an impudent trick. It is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly for Kings Children either to be naked or in rags, ſo it is for them to have on a pied-coloured coat. Good work-men uſe to take meaſure of mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, before they cut out their work; for their own perſons cannot be a Standard for all ſizes; ſo ſhould they do that ſhape garments and faſhions for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; or elſe inſtead of making decent, they will make many ſlovens. Neither will the father ever correct his child, becauſe he cannot put on the coat that pinches him: Methinks the way is more rational, that conſciences ſhould be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of thoſe robes which they themſelvs muſt wear, then that the conſcience ſhould be peiced or clipped according to the faſhion of that garment which a Maſter-workman hath cut out, except he had his pattern from Chriſt. Were I to worſhip for my life, I would worſhip as Chriſt the high Prieſt hath taught me: for in goodneſs as well as in truth, Chriſts <hi>Yea</hi> is <hi>yea,</hi> and his <hi>Nay</hi> is <hi>nay; and whatſoever is more comes of evil:</hi> yet my Palate ſhould not be the meaſure, nor the carver of another mans dyet; for then inſtead of feeding him, I might choake him: and in cutting that which I my ſelf love, I might cut that which he loaths: what though my ſtomack will not take fleſh, ſhall I deny it to another? what though I go plain, yet my faſhion is no more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory to him that loves trimming, then his trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is obligatory to me; all look upon circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as indifferents: why then in an indifferent thing is my conſcience judged of another man?

               <p> BUT becauſe Examples are more potent then Rules, and men are more ready to act by Imitation then Direction; becauſe a Guide along with one, or before one, makes the way more cheerfull; I would ſet before you a Pattern, whoſe practice if you imitate, will lead you to the place which I have pointed at; whoſe ſteps if you tread in, you need no other Guide; for ſhe is newly gone to heaven before you: And now that I come to deſcribe her ſteps, I would not guide my pen by intereſt or affection, but by truth; and that will be the reaſon I make her jorney but ſhort, becauſe ſhe was but a while in my ſight; and I would not ſay any thing on her which I was ignorant of. I dare not poſitively affirm, that ſhe walked in this or that way, becauſe it is of a Goſpel Track, except I my ſelf had been a Spectator: but this liberty I may take, to think that ſhe ſeldom miſſed her way, becauſe ſhe was ſo skilled in holy walking. I know there is a Phyſical Poſsibility, that I may ſpeake the ſame things of the moſt undeſerving perſon in the world, <hi>mutato tantum nomine,</hi> only exchanging the name; but moral neceſſity interdicts me.

My deſign
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:93651:173"/> and ambition in this attempt is only this, that I might write her life as <hi>Suetonius</hi> did the Emperors, <hi>Ea libertate qua vixerunt,</hi> with the ſame liberty that ſhe lived in; and that I may meaſure her ſteps by the ſame line which ſhe walked by. Could I write her deeds with the ſame life that ſhe lived them, and relate her holineſs in as pure a ſtrain, and could I meaſure her parts and graces by a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and a proportional narration, you would ſooner want faith to credit, then I ſhould want matter to write. <hi>Alexander</hi> had his <hi>Apelles</hi> to draw his picture, and rhat Artiſt <hi>Lyſippus</hi> to cut his Statue in braſs: were it ſo with her, you might think that her defects, if there were any, might be conceal'd by the abundance of skill; but when one <hi>(vix idoneus tanto operi,</hi> ſcarce wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to know, much leſs to relate her worth) ſo unskilfull, takes the pen in hand, to tranſcribe ſuch a Copy, no wonder if there be not more blots in the imitation, then flouriſhes in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. They had need be able to ſpeak well, that go about to tranſlate high languages, leſt the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation differ from the Original. My only fear is, that I ſhall cloud her countenance by my Pencil, and make her graces diſdain'd by my unskilfull repreſenting of them. He had need be an <hi>Apelles</hi> that limns <hi>Venus,</hi> or a <hi>Clarenceaux</hi> that blazons the Kings Coat-armour. In that which I ſpeak concerning her, I ſhall not ſo much inſiſt on the Poſture and Condition, upon the Endowments and Qualifications of her body, as of her ſoul; though the variety of conditions that ſhe hath been in, ſince ſhe entered into the priſon and ſhell of the

She found the earth ſlippery. Oh how often did ſhe pitch her Tent, and how ſhort warning had ſhe oftentimes for a removal! How ſhe was fed with the bread of affliction, and yet was well likeing! How oft hath ſhe been in a dry and thirſty land, and yet fainted not! How bitter her cup hath been made, and yet ſhe would drink it with praiſes! How God hath ſmitten the rock, and rebuked the waves for her! How hath he fed her from heaven, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded priſon doores to be opened! I ſhall not ſpeak to thoſe things; I have only heard them; I was not a Spectator, ſo that I cannot declare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perſonal knowledge.

He had been viewing the kingdoms of the earth, and ſeeing the rarities beyond the ſeas; yet I cannot ſay, that ever I diſcerned any great delight he took in them: He had ſeen <hi>Rome,</hi> though he was not ar all tainted with her errors: he btought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many of the rarities of other Nations, but none of their ſins; And after he had viſited what here was below, he ſtayed not long untill he took another journey, to go ſee what they do above; he might ſay as the Travailor coming from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo could he ſay of the world,

               <p n="1">1. Her perſonal qualifications; and becauſe theſe will appear when you ſee how ſhe performed her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective dutyes, I ſhall be but brief. I might not be ſilent as to her profound underſtanding, quick

I might tell you of her abſtract and Metaphyſical contemplation, her Logicall and rationall argumentation: but theſe were the inſtruments of her practice and will ſhine bright; but if you come but to ſee how ſhe wrought, only theſe two or three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. She was of a lowly and humble behaviour, though honourable. She ſhone the brighter, the lower ſhe ſtooped; her humble geſture was winning, like dumb Rhetorick, cauſed a conſent though ſhe had not ſpoken. Yet ſhe ſo carried her ſelf, not as to proſtitute her worth whereby ſhe might become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed. She knew how to hide her face that ſhe might be inquired after, and to unvaile her face that ſhe ſhould be admired; tis true her degree was ſuch, that it was courteſie not debt for her to ſubmit her ſelf to aſſociate with thoſe ſhe did: but ſuch was her skill that her honour was in its proper hight, though her behaviour was lower by many degrees: ſhe had an act to make honour legible in a new edition and a ſmall print: of whom I may truly ſay as <hi>Plin.</hi> of <hi>Epaminondas, honores ita geſſi ti ut ornamentum non accipere ſed dare dignitati videretur;</hi> Honour was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to her for getting it a good name: how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable was it to ſee her <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. She was of a courteous and a tender diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. She had lain long under the warme influence of the ſun, and therefore ſhe had a melting heart. Her tenderneſs like the wool deadned many a dart, when a rigid and auſtere countenance would never have done it; uſually when detracters would be caſting their venome, (for <hi>Morſu virus habent, et fatum deute minantur,</hi> they have a venemous tooth: poiſon of aſps is under their tongues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) yet I have heard them make this concluſion, Yet ſhe was a very ſweet and courteous Lady; which ſeems to blot out all they could ſpeak againſt her, as <hi>Nero's,</hi> but he was a perſecuter, blotted out his other deſerved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.

                  <q>Non ſibi placuit vindicta, ſed victoria.</q> She did not ſo much deſire to revenge, as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Surely if God will not learn at Chriſtians, yet he may juſtly be provoked by Chriſtians; to be hard harted to them, they are ſo hard hearted one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Thus

                  </q> It is for our brazen hearts ſake, if God turne the heaven inro braſſe, and the firmament into iron: ſhe had learnt not only the part of a man, to render

               <p>He ſent ambaſſadors to negotiate for a reconciliation with God, when he had made them at peace with himſelf; and how would it trouble her very heart to think of the ſinners portion, when they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many incomes here! She would often ſeem to be rroubled for their accounts; knowing that where God ſowes plentifully, he expects increaſe; &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Deus tarditatem ſupplicii gravitate compenſat:</hi> the longer God is fetching his ſtroak, the more doth it ſmart when it comes; She had an eare open there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:93651:178"/> to any complaints that might ſtirr up her bowels of compaſſion; here ſhe was ſlow to ſpeak and ſwift to hear, that ſhe might underſtand the Emphaſis of a petitioners miſery, that ſo ſhe need not want motives to mercy. It was ſaid of the Emperor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi> that when a poor ſubject would have preſented a petition to him, he told him he had not leiſure to hear him, to whom the petitioner retorted: Then you ought not to have leiſure to be Emperour. She had been in ſtraits of that nature her ſelf, and that made her ſympathize, and have a fellow-feeling with thoſe in miſery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. She much uſed ro deny her ſelf and make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of her worth, that Chriſt might be all in all: She had a heart above her enjoyments and her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. She denyed her Riches, her eſtate, and was maintained with a poſſeſſion like the ſaints food which every one doth not know of. God had made her a <hi>Sarah</hi> in this, increaſed her with wealth, flocks and herds which was not of her own taking but of her fathers giving: neither was her riches as many ones have been, a Coal ſnatched from the Altar, which will in time fire the neſt; but hers was not ſo, it was <hi>Divino more datum,</hi> not <hi>Sacrilego more rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> She drunk not with <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> in bowles of the ſanctuary, neither did ſhe enrich her ſelf with the ſpoiles of the Temple: She built no houſes with Churches ruines: the foundation of her dwelling place was not laid on a Cathedral; ſhe cloathed not her ſelf with the curtains of the Altar.

She would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten rejoyce that ſhe had not taken that liberty which others had done, to make ſuch laws as Church land might become forfeit, and ſo confiſcated to their own uſe; it was purely her perſwaſion, <hi>Sacrum, ſacroque commodatum qui rapit, parricida eſto;</hi> he who borrows of the Church and payes not again, let him be cut off from the congregation; he that ſteales a Deodand, wrongs his neighbour as well as diſhonours God: but God had given her a large portion which was her inheritance, therefore ſhe would not ſue for other mens annuities; inſtead of plundering ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched the Ambaſſadours of Chriſt with her wealth; She lay out her wealth and riches upon the Knights Hoſpitallors of Chriſt, and maintained his beads<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with the morſell ſhe ſhould have put in her own mouth; had ſhe not then heart to deny her eſtate? She looked not to lay up great things on earth, nor make any purchaſe of Lands but in <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. She denyed her parts: not as many do that will pretend to ſacrifice them, but it is to let the people ſee they have them; indeed hers were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to no ordinary pitch; yet in all her knowledge ſhe was not ſatisfied, ſave in the knowledge of the eternall God, and his ſon Chriſt whom he hath ſent: and though ſhe would not ſet her light on the hill top, nor fire beacons with it, for ſhe was of a more peaceable ſpirit; Yet

I have indeed ſo metimes wondered, out of what fountaine ſhe drew her knowledge: but after I had conſidered that it was all ſpiritual, I thought it to be given of God: ſhe would judge of controverted Doctrine by her practice; that way wherein ſhe could run faſteſt to heaven was the way ſhe owned: and as to her expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and election, they that knew her have heard her ſpeak for her ſelf, ſo that I need not; only let me ſay as <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſaid of <hi>

               <p n="3">3. She denyed her graces: ſhe would go to Chriſt with a preſent of that plenty which ſhe had received from him: the mercyes of God to her were not like the wind, which drives one from the coaſt it comes from, but like the beams of the ſun which draw the eye to the fountaine of light: the more ſhe had lain under influences, and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhe grew, the neerer would ſhe creep to the fire: and when ſhe was filled with the drops of heaven, ſhe would empty herſelf into the Ocean: Oh how far was ſhe from <hi>Nebuchadnezzers</hi> frame! <hi>Dan.</hi>

She would (oh that all Parents of Children would improve ſo great a mercy in the like kind!) ſooner correct them for neglecting their duty ro God, then for diſobedience to her ſelf; and this made them more cautious, in as much as they apprehended every fault in that kind to be double, not only againſt their ſpiritual, but their natural pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: her Childrens behaviour &amp; their ſanctified lives will put a <hi>Probatum eſt</hi> to this particular, ſo that I may be ſilent; therefore ſhe needed not complain (neither indeed had ſhe any cauſe) as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> did, who had a rebellious and an ungracious ſon, <hi>Utinam aut coelebs vixiſſem, aut orbus periiſſem,</hi> Would God (ſaid he) that I had never married, or that I had never had a child. She in their infancy and mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity made choice for them; but when they were at riper years, ſhe would let them chuſe for themſelves; knowing that it is not ſo eaſie to love where one is forced, as it is to be forced where one loves: ſhe would not chuſe Yoke-fellows for her Children, not knowing ſo well whither they would draw both one way, as they themſelves knew: hence ſhe urged not any that went againſt the ſtomack, leſt ſhe ſhould cauſe ſurfet or vomit: ſhe judged it rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to impoſe a husband or wife on her child, except they ſhould take them as Phyſick, only to have them ſtay with them for a day, and no more. It ſeems a hard queſtion to reſolve, Whither the Parent that forces is more cruel, or the child that denies more diſobedient?</p>

To the Saints; ſhe ſhewed much love, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in their miſery: ſhe looked upon the Children of God as her own kindred, ſo that ſhe could not but have affection; the ſpirit of love which knit both them and her to the head, did alſo knit both them &amp; her together in the ſame body as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of another: How could it be otherwiſe, but thoſe eminent in grace ſhould have her eſteem, becauſe they were like her ſelf! and ſhe who had the ſeed abiding in her; could not but grow up in the likeneſs of him that begat her of his own will;
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:93651:183"/> it was ordinary to ſee her and the Children of Chriſt <hi>Columbatim labris inſerentes labra;</hi> ſhe was indeed a Dove for harmleſneſs, and a Dove for meekneſs and affection; thence the Greeks derive <gap reason="foreign">

Oh what a free acceſs could the meaneſt of the Lords Children have unto her, when thoſe that were the darlings of the world might ſtand without! Her boſome was as open to thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got of the Spirit of life, as to thoſe begot of her own body. Chriſts meaneſt ſervant was in equal reſpect with the worlds greateſt maſter: when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was made known to her by the characters of faith and praiſe, there was a note of remembrance put upon ſuch, and of all others ſhe loved to keep reconciled to, and avoided contracting enmity with thoſe whom the Lord loved. It was ſtoried of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> that upon ſome affront he intended to wage war with the Biſhop of <hi>Magd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:93651:183"/> loved, nor to oppoſe, or be in enmity with them to whom God was reconciled; wherever ſhe ſaw the Characters of a Goſpel Converſation, there ſhe would alſo make impreſions of her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>She gave much honour and due reſpect to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel; this was one of the talleſt branches of her affection; theſe were the men that found favour in her ſight, becauſe as Embaſſadors of Chriſt, they alwayes brought her tidings from above: But as for thoſe Miniſters clothing, but whoſe lives rather ſupported the Kingdom of ſin, then the intereſt of Chriſt, ſhe ſuffered them not to have an equal ſhare with the reſt. She would alway judge a ſin in a Miniſter moſt unbecomming. A Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans converſation under a Clergy-mans apparrel, profaneſs under a gown, was an unſeemly ſight to her; worldly ſtuff is not to be treaſured up in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters hearts; ſhe would ſay, that it made many think more undervaluingly of heaven, when thoſe that went to ſpie out the land, had their hearts ſo much on earth. She ſaw that it made the price diſeſteemed, when the guide would not lay aſide his weights and burdens, that he might run with more ſpeed: this made <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſo much complain of ſpiritual men, when they had their hearts on earthly things. <hi>Amor rerum terrenarum, eſt viſcus ſpiritualium pennarum,</hi> Love to the food of the body, is as birdlime to the wings of the ſoul, it intangles them. And again, <hi>Negotiatorem Clericum quaſi quandam peſtem fuge,</hi> the Peſtilence is not more infectious, then a worldly minded Miniſter is to his people.

The Goſpel and the Meſſengers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel were both as Jewels to her, and ſhe delighted much to wear them. <hi>Nunquam requievit niſi in Evangelio aut clauſtro;</hi> ſhe ſlept ſafeſt when ſhe had heard ſome ſpiritual diſcourſe laſt at a night for her to dream on; and thought her ſelf moſt ſecure when ſome godly Miniſter lodged in her houſe: ſhe was one, that though ſhe did give them entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet ſhe would have them work; and though ſhe lodged them, ſhe would ſeldom let them reſt; few could have the honor of a viſit under a Sermon: She would ordinarily be rubbing them for fear they ſhould ruſt; ſhe would not by any means that a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpencer of the Oracles of God ſhould be idle.

Oh what an Ecclipſe muſt the earth ſuffer, when not only the mutable Moon, but ſtars alſo interpoſe between the eye and the ſun? what ſorrow muſt that poor ſoul undergo where the

She would have theſe to be highly eſteemed, but that they ſhould ſit bare to the illumination of the mind with ſaving grace. She would have learning ſubordinate to Grace; as <hi>Clemens Alex. ſubmittat ſe ut Hagar Sarae, patiatur ſe admoneri &amp; corrigi; ſin minus pareat, ejice ancillam;</hi> it ſhould be a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and no Commandreſs, as <hi>Agar</hi> was to <hi>Sarah</hi> under ſubjection, which if ſhe refuſed obedience, was to be caſt out, and diſinherited.

She was one that thought it heterogenous for a Travailour to prompt an experienced guide; deſiring that thoſe who had been judged fit to lead others, ſhould do it in the way they knew beſt, not in that which was troden moſt; for the way of experience may be nearer then the common road: and the Travailor may come to have better entertainment at his journeys end. Such who ſhone as lights in a dark place, they were the men that her tender eye was upon: they were the men whom ſhe loved; and indeed her love was great: Oh how nobly would ſhe entertain them, and how welcome were they to her prefence, if they had but brought any goſpel tidings, any meſſage of peace, any news from heaven to her ſoul! a perſecuted <hi>Paul</hi> as well as a pompous <hi>Herod, Peter</hi> in chains as well as <hi>Julian</hi> in his Chollar of Gold <gap reason="foreign">

Cloth of gold, and a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring were but rags when on a Leopards back; and plain Leather was not deſpiſed, when the perſon was undefiled within. I dare boldly ſay of her in this particular, as one ſaid of <hi>Origen, Nemo fere ſupervivit aequalis,</hi> ſhe hath ſcarce left her fellow in the land. She would uſually after they were

I have heard her ſay frequently, that a powerfull Miniſter of the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould have as honourable treatment, and be as nobly entertained by her as any Lord in the Land. Oh <hi>Si plures eſſent, &amp; diutius durarent,</hi> that we had but more ſuch, and that they would ſtay longer! And indeed, for ought I know, they brought and left many a bleſſing at her family.

                  <l>Sic vos non vobis nidificatis aves:</l>
                  <l>Sic vos non vobis vellera fertis oves.</l>

               </lg>
               <p>She would often pity poor ſouls that ſwim down the ſtream of corruption, without any ſtriving, either to ſave life, or to get to ſhore; ſhe would pity them as ſhe would do a mad man, or a peeviſh child who will tear off his cloaths, and trample on his food, though it be that without which he cannot live: ſhe would ſeem inwardly to grieve, to think what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur there would be, as to many mens titles to glory, who yet thought they were full and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The laſt relational duty which I ſhall mention, is, how ſhe carried her ſelf in her family: ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it like ro her garden, (where ſhe was very curious and exact) as in that no weeds might be ſeen; ſo in her houſe ſhe ſuffered not a ſin to grow: ſhe knew how ſoon ſuch noxious trees would not only bring a curſe upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but even upon the ground they ſtood on; therefore as ſhe planted no ſuch; yet if they grew up ſuch, and changed their nature, ſhe would ſoon pull them up. She would require in all thoſe that waited upon her, to keep the inſide of the cup clean, (I mean the heart) as well as the out-ſide; as ſhe would not endure to eat her meat in unclean veſſels, nor be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by thoſe of unwaſhen hands; ſo ſhe
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:93651:189"/> would expect their hearts ſhould alſo be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that came to live under her roof: Her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who frequented her preſence, were to have their bodies free from dirt, and their ſouls waſhed from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, or elſe they were not entertained: this I was fully convinced of, that no quality in her ſervant, gained ſo much reſpect and love from her, as grace in the heart; though ſometime ſhe hath weighed the little ſervice which ſhe could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from ſome, yet that would not move her to part with them, but ſhe would keep them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe gracious: and when ſhe hath been told of the inſufficiency of ſome, ſhe would make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>But they are honeſt.</hi> She conſidered, that thoſe who were gracious, had a bleſſing attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, though they could do little: and though they could not work much, yet if they prayed, the work would be well done, though but little. She would often ſay, how can any ſerve me faithfully, and perform their duty as they ought, when they make no conſcience of ſerving God? at the beſt they will but be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Men-pleaſers,</hi> and their work be it never ſo much, it will be but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice,</hi> which the Apoſtle willed not, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 6. Oh what an example did ſhe ſet! How fair a Copy, and how true letters did many write after her! I durſt ſpeak it with boldneſs, (were it proper for me that am a member of the family my ſelf to ſay ſo) that in her houſe ſhe had proportionally as many ſervants, who ſet
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:93651:190"/> their faces towards Sion, and loved the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity and in truth, as was in any noble family in the land! How rare was it to hear a profane word, or ſee a profane geſture! From the time of my coming to dwell with her Ladyſhip, untill her death, I cannot ſay that ever I heard an oath, neither ſee man drunk in the houſe, ſave one. It was an houſe where grace was ſmiled upon, and where ſin lay under a reproach. Oh what ſtriving was there which ſhould get to heaven firſt, which did much improve both our graces and our duties! the wayes of God were not there evil ſpoken of; if her Ladyſhip had known it, ſhe would have ſoon ſtopped their mouths. She manured the ſoil with Goſpel inſtructions; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhe generally entertained an able Divine in her houſe; though I cannot ſay ſo by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſince I dwelt with her; neither would I, thought I might; yet for the moſt part ſhe endeavoured to have both the learned and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, whom ſhe did not keep to be idle; neither did ſhe imploy them without abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly rewarding them. She alwayes thought a Miniſter in her houſe, though coſtly, yet to be great riches; and would ſay, maintaining a godly Chaplain, makes no man poor. Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was promoted ſo by her encouragement, and by the Chaplains induſtry, that it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in the ſervants to be ambitious which ſhould be beſt, not which ſhould be greateſt. She was exact in keeping a due order, that her
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:93651:190"/> family might know when to ſerve her, and when to ſerve God. As ſhe diſcerned any noxious weeds to grow up, ſhe would ſo influence them with her frowns, that their natures were often changed; but if that would not do, ſhe would root them out. The weeds that ſhe would labour to pull out, were ſuch as were either uſeleſs or infectious, or both: though ſhe could not eradicate ſin where it was out of her reach, yet ſhe would diſquiet it where ſhe had any thing to do; a little to ſhew what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications her ſervants were to have, and what ſins ſhe diſeſteemed in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. She entertained no prophane; alwayes fearing, that they like pitch or a leproſie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file all they touch, or blaſt all they go about to do: She as much feared to entertain a man or woman dead in treſpaſſes or ſin, as the <hi>Jews</hi> feared to touch a dead body, becauſe of their uncleanneſs: and though I cannot tell how ſhe would have carried to ſuch in her own family, (for there was none that durſt be ſo, and ſo known to her) yet by her diſlike of that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and indulgence in others, ſhe ſhewed that a prophane man ſhould not have gone without his reward: it is true, to be deboiſt, is a merry life, if there were to be no account hereafter, when we come to dye: or if the moſt Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſhould be the moſt deifyed hereafter, it would be the beſt work to do nothing at all: and the only time would be to redeem no time;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:93651:191"/> but there is a dreadfull ſentence, <hi>Go ye curſed;</hi> and that will need no Emphaſis; it is heavy enough in this, to be ſeparated from God: whom to enjoy is life eternal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. She would not at all encourage formality or ſuperſtition; ſhe would not permit that any ſhould perform their ſervice to God after a dead manner, no more then perform their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to her ſleepingly: As for the ſuperſtition, ſhe counted it a Criticiſm; in worſhip, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement: ſuch a flection, that they who can ſuit themſelves in every poſture, had need be better Grammarians then Divines: ſhe would not have hers ſo clowniſh and formal, as to keep their ſeat, though it was in the preſence of the King of Kings; nor ſo complemental, as to cringe and congee to every butterflye: but becauſe theſe are ſins might eaſily be removed in their cauſe, ſhe looked well to that; and that was,</p>
               <p n="3">3. She laboured, as that hers ſhould not be wholy blinded by profaneſs; ſo that they ſhould not be hood-winked with ignorance; knowing it is as eaſie for Satan to cauſe an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ſoul to worſhip a ſtone, and idolize a word, as it was for the boy that lead venerable <hi>Beda,</hi> to make him preach to a heap of ſtones, telling him, that they were men. It was not comfortable to her that any of her family ſhould walk blind-folded, daſhing their feet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:93651:191"/> ſtones, or ſplitting upon rocks, and making ſhipwrack of faith. She did not train them up <hi>Andabatorum more, tenebris &amp; dubitaudi cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine palpitantes;</hi> therefore was it that ſhe had a light alwayes in the houſe that ſhould guide them the way to heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. She would not abide that adrunkard ſhould come in her ſight, though it was not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in my time, becauſe there was not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for her to teſtifie her diſtate as in her own: yet by what I have heard from her as relating to others, I can affirm, that they were a very loathſome crue to her; With what an Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis would ſhe pronounce the word <hi>Breast,</hi> when ſhe had reproved any that had been guilty of that ſin! And indeed that ſin ſeems to be ſtrangely unnatural, becauſe it takes away for the preſent, that whereby man is diſtinguiſhed from bruit beaſts; to wit, the more lively exerciſe of his rational faculties. It would trouble her to ſee it in others, (though ſhe prevented it in her own) that lived like <hi>Bonoſus,</hi> as though they were born <hi>ut biberent, non ut viverent:</hi> of whom is was ſaid, and that according to his deſert, when he had hanged himſelf, <hi>There hangs a Tankard, not a man.</hi> I have read, when <hi>Aeſchines</hi> in a diſcourſe with <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> was commending <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> for a brave man, who would drink much: <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> replyes, that, that was a good quality in a ſpunge, but not in a man: This is the door at which many other
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:93651:192"/> evils enter. How often would ſhe ſay, to that effect, with <hi>Bernard, Ad univerſa, vel crudeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, vel turpitudinis facinora perpetranda faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis invenitur via, cui nulla ſobria ment is ratio, ſed ebrietas dominatur:</hi> How ſoon is the courſe of nature inflamed, and all on a fire, when there is moſt drink in the brain!</p>
               <q>Quid enim Venus ebria curat!</q>
               <p>And as ſhe hated this ſin in all, ſo eſpecially in Miniſters: a Drunken Clergy man was like great wits ſet upon wrong Objects, moſt pernitious: The <hi>Monks,</hi> that abſtemous generation, call the beſt wine, <hi>Vinum Theologicum,</hi> Divine wine, and beſt befitting themſelves to drink; but in them this ſin would be <hi>peccatum diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> ſenſual deviliſh: when corrupted, it makes the tarteſt vinegar; ſo the corrupted Clergy make the moſt prophane.</p>
               <p n="5">5. She was cautious of entertaining any <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> into her houſe, leſt any that were legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and true born children of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould loſe their birth-righ, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming brats of the harlot: againſt whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſhe was not, becauſe they were theirs, but becauſe they varied from Chriſts rule; and the rather, becauſe they might eaſily miſguide thoſe belonging to her, when they had wrought in them an implicite faith, that their agents muſt be believed upon their own report; as
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:93651:192"/> eaſily as one may be miſled when their eyes are put out: the ſoul is ſoon raviſht of truth when locked up in darkneſs, and caſt on the bed of licentiouſneſſe. Two things ſhe would much diſlike, (though ſhe would not perſecute for their ſober judgements, but puniſh for their groſs ſins)</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their training up the vulgar in ignorance, as though none can be led to heaven with their eyes open, but they muſt all wink. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them their ſervice in a known language; there is ſmall proficiency like to be made, when none muſt know whereto he hath attained; and people can ſcarce aſſure themſelves of the way, when all their teſtimonie is the word of a fallible, if not a falſe Guide; for they allow them not the rule of truth to be made intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible: this is an Engine whereby they gain ſo many Proſilytes: Surely the land or perſon is in an uncomfortable condition where knowledge hath quit poſſeſſion. It is reported that at the Aſſembly of States in <hi>Germany,</hi> one <hi>Albertus</hi> a Biſhop, by chance lighting on a Bible, as he was reading, one of the States asked him what he had got, what book that was? he anſwered, he did not know what it was; but wherever he read in it, he found it to be againſt their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their licentious converſations: their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the power of godlineſs; as it is well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in that Diſtick:</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:93651:193"/>
                  <l>Vivere qui ſancte cupitis, diſcedite Roma.</l>
                  <l>Omnia cum liceant, non licet eſſe pium.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And if all their Popes muſt be believed, as not capable of ſpeaking falſe, why may not <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, when he ſaith, <hi>Cum eſſem religioſus, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabam bene de ſalute animae meae: Cardinalis factus extimui; Pontifex creatus, pene despero:</hi> When I was in my low condition, and addicted my ſelf to the ſervice of God, I hop'd well of my ſalvation; being made Cardinal, I began to doubt and fear; but being created Pope, I am altogether in deſpair. It would be well, if they did not prefer their <hi>Utile</hi> before their <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestum;</hi> their gain before godlineſs; witneſs their priviledged ſins: A ſad State where is a toleration to be wicked, and not to be true: to do unjuſtly, but not to ſpeak truly. <hi>Fac me Pontificem, &amp; ero Chriſtianus;</hi> make me a Pope, and I will be a Chriſtian; was an argument, that that man who ſaid it, was a follower of Chriſt rather for what he had, then for what he was; for loaves, then for his perſon.</p>
               <p n="6">6. She would not permit an oath to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced twice: and as for a lye, ſhe would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inquiſitive, where ſhe had a ſuſpition; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Tenue est mendatium pellucet, ſi diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inspexeris;</hi> lyes bluſh, and betray themſelves, if they be looked on; ſo ſhe would ſearch to the very bottom of a frivolous excuſe, and let
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:93651:193"/> out the very dregs, to ſee if the cask was not tainted.</p>
               <p n="7">7. She loved not that any under her ſhould eſteem themſelves according to the quality of whom they ſerved, or the place which they were in; but according to what they were in themſelves: She would ſay as <hi>Severus</hi> ſaid of the Empire, The management of any of her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants place and truſt conſiſted not in bravery, but in vertue: and here ſhe did not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, but gave an example: though ſhe had an Apologie of honour and wealth to ſpeak on her behalf; yet ſhe needed no excuſe, who could not be accuſed as guilty of pride: and though ſhe was ſo great, as <hi>Nemo major, niſi quae juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> none excels, that falls ſhort of her grace; yet <hi>Gratius fuit nomen pietatis, quam poteſtatis;</hi> holineſs took the place of honour, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was made ſtoop to Godlineſſe's feet: And though ſhe had much to boaſt of, yet ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not upon any thing as her own, but as bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed; and when ſhe was any way tempted to pride her ſelf in her attainments, ſhe would then ſtill the temptation, by thinking of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them again with intereſt for the uſe of them. It was ſaid of Mr. <hi>John Fox,</hi> that his grace did him more harm then his ſins, becauſe he was apt to be puffed up: but it was not ſo with her, who was hindred from magnifying her ſelf, by making experiments of her own emptineſs; and this example did ſhe ſet to her ſervants;
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:93651:194"/> and many were imitators thereof: As ſhe was clothed her ſelf, ſo ſhe deſired that hers ſhould be in the ſame faſhion; not gaudy, but comly; not coſtly, but uſefull; not light, but neat. She was arrayed, and ſo ſhe deſired hers to be, <hi>Sirico pietatis, beſſino ſanctitatis, &amp; purpura pudicitiae;</hi> with holineſs and modeſty: and many ſhe had about her that wore this Livery. She loved a humble heart; and would uſually make them ſit loweſt, who had the higheſt looks: ſhe alwayes had a favourable aſpect for a modeſt countenance; but a majeſtick frown on thoſe <hi>Quos pudit non eſſe impudentes,</hi> who were moſt aſhamed when they were not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p n="8">8. She would not permit any private quarrel and conteſts, but keep peace one with another: She was diſpleaſed with the conteſts which ſhe ſaw in other houſes; but ſhe forbad it in her own: ſhe endeavoured to bring <hi>Iſhmael</hi> under the power of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> though ſhe could not change his nature, ſhe would tye his hands: and they in her houſe who were of the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, were not trampled on by the Serpents ſeed; neither were the Lords Freemen brought into bondage by the worlds flaves, or ſins vaſſals. She did ſo moderate their enmity, and ſo tame the rage of the Lyon, that he would let the Lamb lye down, and not devour it: though ſhe could not keep the godly under her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from reproaches, yet ſhe would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:93651:194"/> keep them from harms; which brought ſuch an eſteem of holineſs, that made her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſtrive which ſhould be moſt pure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch had the greateſt ſhew of her love: And thus I have given you her behaviour in her relational duties.</p>

               <p n="4">4. She had appretiating thoughts of Chriſt: She had meditated on his love and tenderneſs: and this affected her. She was like iron toucht with the Load-ſtone; no ſooner touched then drawn: There was an ardency in her heart to him who had influenced her by his own love; and it was of an aſſimilating nature that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſame effects in her, that Chriſts did in him. Sitting by the fire made her tender to others; ſhe would not wound, becauſe Chriſt came to heal; not deſtroy, when he came to ſave; not hate, ſeeing he came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eoncile. Oh what a correſpondency did that love produce in her nature with the nature of Chriſt! ſuch was her heat, that it even dryed her up.</p>
               <q>Amor eſt hilare tormentum.</q>
               <p>To dye of love is a ſweet death. When ſhe had ſuch an object, ſhe could not exceed in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring or embracing. She was very fervent, and it cannot be otherwiſe, becauſe her heart
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:93651:198"/> had been touched with a ſpark from Chriſts flaming breaſt. She warmed others by that fire kindled for her own uſe: neither could you wonder that ſhe fell in love with Chriſt, being ſhe had ſeen him ſo often in his glory, and found him to be ſo ſutable a Saviour to her, when ſhe lay under the ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in her own conſcience. Oh how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable was it to lie warming ones ſelf by ſo great a heat!</p>

                  </q> She ran not wantonly, but in the heat of her zeal, enquiring of every one ſhe met, if they ſaw her beloved: and ſuch a poſture would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry its Apology with it, if they would conſider, ſhe was ſick of love.

A tempting world, nor a gawdy pleaſure had ever any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to diſintangle her: She would tread on other things, that ſhe might reach the higher towards God. When I conſider what a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born-ſoul hers was, I cannot but conclude, as <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> did, when he ſaw his ſon <hi>Alexander</hi> leaping on <hi>Bucephalus</hi> his great horſe, he wept upon him, and kiſſed him, and told him, he might ſeek another kingdom; <hi>Macedonia</hi> was too little for him. So it was with her; the greatneſs of her mind was not commenſurate to preſent Objects: her facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had a tendency to the preſervation of the head. She grudged not that Chriſt the head, which contained the power of ſeeing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſhould have dominion over the other members. She grudged not that the fountain ſhould be exalted above the Ciſtern, leſt influences ſhould not be conveighed. She loved her Jeſus with <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:93651:199"/> When ſhe went to duty, it was in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt; When ſhe went to Church, it was to meet Chriſt; When into her Cloſet, it was to embrace her Chriſt: When ſhe read or meditated, it was that Chriſt might be more fully diſcovered unto her. I may boldly ſay of her, as one ſaid of <hi>Cicero Hortentius,</hi> That every book was rejected by her, wherein ſhe found not the name of Jeſus; and this love made her very active; made her a Volunteer in Theological War: ſuch a bond it was, that neither the ſtorms of a cloudy day could rot, nor the heat of a fiery furnace could burn, nor the ſword of a Tyrannical perſecutor could cut, nor the flutterings of a glazing world could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice aſundet: It was not the damnations of the prophane, nor the <hi>Hail Madam</hi> of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite that could ſeparate her from her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
               <p n="5">. 5 She had a high eſteem of the everlaſting Goſpel: like <hi>Budaeus</hi> his wife, <hi>Non tractavit negligentius libros quam liberos:</hi> ſhe was as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Goſpel of Chriſt, as of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her child: as ſhe delighted to ſee his perſon, ſo did ſhe to hear his voice: what ever charge ſhe gave, in her ſhield ſhe bore the goſpel in chief, over which, <hi>A heart ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted proper:</hi> it was there that ſhe found food for her ſoul, and direction on her way. She would ſay to the ſame purpoſe that <hi>Cheraea</hi> did, <hi>Haec ego non facerem quae Jupiter fecit?</hi> what ſhall
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:93651:200"/> Chriſt ſet me an example, and ſhall not I imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate? Shall he go before, and I ſtay behind? She delighted in the ſame manner that <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Cicily</hi> did in the book of God; who once acquainting <hi>Petrarcha</hi> with his affections to the Word, and Intereſt of Chriſt, ſaid, <hi>juro ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Petrarcha, multo chariores eſſe literas quam Regnum; &amp; ſi alterutro carendum ſit, aequani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius me Diademate quam Literis cariturum;</hi> I prize the Goſpel more then my Crown; and if one muſt be left, I profeſs I had rather loſe my Kingdome then the Scriptures. Oh ſhe often felt a ſecret wound that ſhe received from the word of Truth, which came with pleaſure, not with ſmart: <hi>Evangelii verba leviter volant, ſed graviter vulnerant,</hi> the Goſpel is but a Word, but it makes an impreſſion; it cuts deep, though the wounds are more delightfull then painfull: How often would ſhe go to this glaſs to dreſs her ſelf by! and thence was it that ſhe was ſo comly: ſhe did not only look in the glaſs for her own face, but ſhe thereby got a fight of the Fathers Throne, as by the light of the Sun ſhe got a ſight of his footſtool. She loved to ſit under the beams of the Sun; and though it did make her black, (for ſhe thereby lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſdain of the more degenerate part of the world) yet ſhe was comly; nither would ſhe put a vail over her face, when ſhe went to behold the Sun, but would labour to view him without eclipſing any of his brightneſs, by the ſhadows of Types, or the vails of Tradition.
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:93651:200"/> She loved to ſee light immediatly from the fountain, not by reflexion orderivation; for then the heat and vigor was ſomething abated. God made two great Lights, the light of the Sun to rule the day, and the light of the Moon to rule the night; of which things, I may ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Agar,</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el: Gal.</hi> 4 <gap reason="foreign">

This was the Object of her eye; Oh ſhe loved to ſit in this light, where nothing ſhould cloud

One thing (that I may allude to <hi>Davids</hi> words) ſhe deſired of the Lord, and that ſhe ſought for, that ſhe might dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of her life, and inquire in his Temple. <hi>David</hi> got intelligence in the ſanctuary, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 73, 16, 17. So did ſhe, ſhe went to enquire of God, to ſeek his face, to pray to him, to praiſe him in the ſanctuary. She could ſpeak in his language, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 63. 1, 2. <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee; my ſoul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee in a dry and</hi>

She would allow ceremonious geſtures in ſtrangers that had not been at all acquainted with God; but ſhe could not think it becoming ſons to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous in Congees before his father: being the Father is content with the heart, though ſhe would not commend a clowniſh garb and a ruſtick behaviour in Gods houſe, yet ſhe would

She was not a Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt in her worſhip to the Goſpel rule; but when Chriſt bid go, ſhe would go: and when he ſaid Do this, ſhe would do it.

               <p n="1">1. She could not be unſettled by the worlds allurements: ſhe had experienced their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery who had their portion in this life; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had rather not gaine the world then loſe her own ſoul: ſhe did not eſteem <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſius</hi> his cup of gold ſo highly as ſhe did <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanthus</hi> his kiſſe: ſhe had conſidred the Preachers Epitaph of the world, All is vanity and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirit, and hence was it that ſhe was ſo much out of love with the world, becauſe it knew not the father; when ſhe was on her death-bed, ſhe bid us not pray for her and begg her life; for ſhe deſired to be diſſolved
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:93651:215"/> and to be with Chriſt: the taſte of Spiritual food, and the dantyes of heaven were ſo freſh on her palate, that the things of the world had but a bad ſavour: ſhe did not reliſh the worlds traſh, that had fed ſo plenteouſly on the Manna of heaven: ſhe could not be allured with puddle water, that had ſuch ſoul-ſatisfying draughts of the pure fountaine above: nothing would quench her thirſt but rock water, which rock was Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor by wicked mens reproaches; ſhe durſt venture to truſt all with God, though ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners did diſhearten her; ſhe believed that God would never leave her except ſhe left him firſt; it was a ſaying of Cardinall <hi>Wollſeyes,</hi> when he grew in diſgrace under <hi>Henry</hi> 8. which ſhe could witneſs to be true; quoth he (when one was pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying him that was ſo contemptible, who had been ſo remarkable) Had I been as carefull to ſerve my God of heaven, as I have been to ſerve my King on the earth, he would not have left me in my gray hairs; Indeed ſome have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to caſt aſperſions on her, (as they had need be very bad that have the worlds commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations or good report) but ſhe was not ſo, but carried ſuch a brightneſs in her behaviour that would darken all manner of diſparagement; and notwithſtanding aſperſions, yet would make ber reputation legible: She would not love her ſelf, nor pride her ſelf the more, becauſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men ſpoke well of her, but would rather
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:93651:216"/> examine what evil ſhe had done, when ſhe was extolled by carnal and profane men. She did live amongſt ſuch Leeches, who ſuck the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt blood, if there be any; or I may call them Cupping-glaſſes, which draw the worſt humors: but I have examined ſome of their reports, and have found as much truth in them as the Doctor at <hi>Sorbon</hi> found for the juſtification of the Maſs, from the Poſtſcript of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, where he found in the Latin, <hi>Miſſa eſt,</hi> though in the Original, in all the Poſtſcripts it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <l>Haeſit lac inter meditans interque cruorem:</l>

               <p>She often ſtood to contemplate the Virgins pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the ſons innocency, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhe would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:93651:216"/> abound in works then wealth; and if a ſpotleſs converſation, as well as a gorgeous gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not oblige ſinners to give their good words, ſhe thought them not worth enquiring after, nor worth thanks when obtained. She did not think that the foundation of her eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment was laid on the breath of a few exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Eulogiums</hi> and commendations; therefore ſhe would not <hi>Adorare vulgus, jacere oſcula, &amp; ſerviliter agere pro imperio:</hi> ſhe would not be irregular for their approbation, nor do evil though they would deifie her for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor by Satans temptations: as the flower could not allure, nor bad report ſhame her, ſo neither could the fiery dart affright her from her reſolution. She was compaſſed about with ſnares (as every Chriſtian is, who is not in a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) yet ſhe eſcaped; and when the number was ſo great that they ſeemed to cloud the ſight of heaven from her, yet ſhe could fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of Chriſts wing: often was ſhe ſurrounded ſo with enemies, that ſhe ſeemed to be in the ſame poſture with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his Army; when they had the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> before them, and the Sea behind them: who were told they muſt either eat up that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or drink up that ſea, or there was no way to eſcape; ſo ſhe, there was the Ocean of Gods wrath behind, and an hoſt of ſins before, which made her fight ſtoutly, and reſiſt ſtedfaſtly, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then fall into either of the dangers: many
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:93651:217"/> times there lay a Serpent in the way, which muſt either be ſlain, or it would make her ſtop her courſe, or turn out of the path; either of which ſhe was unwilling to do. And in as much as the beſt Chriſtians are Satans greateſt enemies, therefore they ſhall be moſt aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Satan needs not tempt his own, no more then one needs make an exhortatory oration to a dead body to keep in the grave, or a priſoner in the Goal not to ramble abroad: ſo Satan himſelf anſwered an Exociſt, who going to conjure an evil ſpirit out of a Maids body, the ſpirit would not ſtir, but after many proffers to the ſpirit which was all refuſed, the Exorciſt having a great deſire to free the Damſel, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the ſpirit to come into his body, if it would but leave hers, imagining that the evil ſpirit would prefer a room in him before the Damſels; to whom the ſpirit anſwered, <hi>Quid opus eſt eum tentare, quem noviſſimo die, jure optimo poſſeſſurus ſum?</hi> What need is there that I ſhould remove my habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come into thee, when I have poſſeſſion already? Theſe were <hi>Bella Theologica,</hi> holy religious Wars: <hi>Quae tardius deflagrant, &amp; ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius exureſeunt,</hi> which are long in kindling, yet ſoon conſume all: theſe were <hi>Satanae profundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,</hi> Satans depths; yet ſhe could wade through them when the wind &amp; ſtorms were at heigheſt.</p>
               <p>She kept her Chriſtian courage until death, with the ſenſe of her reconciliation: the eye of her faith was ſuch, that it diſcovered the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:93651:217"/> arm of God, and ſtrength in his right hand; With <hi>Scipio Spem poſuit,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhe placed her comfort in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt, not in her own: She could hope when the veſſel leeked: and ſhe could believe where ſhe did not ſee: <hi>For Faith is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeen. Fides Chriſtiana non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet meritum, ubi ratio humana quaerit experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi> Greg. It is not true and genuine, but a ſpurious and adulterous faith that looks for a ſign: She was not of them who in times of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement profeſs they will dye with Chriſt; but when danger comes, deny him: not of the multitude, that when the high Prieſts are inclinable to own him, call him a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; but when they ſeek to put him to death, call him the <hi>Prince the of Devils.</hi> Not of them who in his triumph cry <hi>Hoſannah:</hi> but in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, cry, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him:</hi> but having appeared in the perſon of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> would not act <hi>Therſites:</hi> having on the ſhield of faith, would not retreat: and having ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the rock, would not hoiſe ſail with the ſtream: having begun in the Spirit, ſhe would not end in the fleſh: and being engrafted into the Myſtical body of Chriſt the Church, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vine, ſhe would not be tranſplanted or inoculated into the wild Olive. She reſolved with her ſelf that ſhe would dye ſtanding; <hi>Ut oportet Miniſtrum coucionantem, ſic oportet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianum ſtantem mori:</hi> as it becomes a Miniſter to dye preaching, ſo it becomes a Chriſtian to
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:93651:218"/> dye practiſing: if he muſt dye giving out en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, a Chriſtian muſt die with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. She had towards the concluſion of her Warfare betaken her ſelf to the ſheild of faith, and under that ſhe ſhelterred her ſelf: and when ſhe had the laſt enemy to grapple with, ſhe feared not, but rather deſired his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: <hi>Non ſic vixit, ut mori timeret;</hi> ſhe did not live ſo filthily or diſhoneſtly, that ſhe ſhould be aſhamed or afraid to die. She did not ſhrink at all at the face of death, but freely drunk of that cup which Chriſt had brewed for her, and drank the dregs too; ſhe went boldly to the Serpents neſt, when Chriſt had taken the ſting out; as <hi>Cyprian</hi> comforted himſelf, in like manner did ſhe; <hi>Minatur Antichriſtus? Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus tuetur: Mors infertur? immortalitas ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur? Mundus eripitur? ſed Paradiſus exhibetur. Vita temporalis extinguitur? ſed aeterna reparatur. Mors Chriſtiano ludus eſt:</hi> Doth Antichriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn? Chriſt juſtifies. Doth death look pale? Immortality is lovely and freſh: Is the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a thirſty place? yet Paradiſe overflows: Doth the ſeed rot? yet it brings forth ſixty, or an hundred fold. She was not aſhamed to live, becauſe ſhe had made ſuch progreſs: ſhe was not afraid to dye, becauſe ſhe was ſo well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Indeed when the grim looks of death made their firſt approach, ſhe not being well compoſed, found Satan endeavouring to captivate her to death, as he hath endeavoured to captivate her by ſin before; and then her
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:93651:218"/> ſpirits were ſurpriſed with ſudden apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her diſſolution: who the ſecond day after her ſickneſs ſent for me, and uttered her ſelf in theſe very words, <hi>Oh Mr</hi> Firth, <hi>I am afraid to die in this condition, my heart hath deceived me! Good Sir, Pray for the light of Chriſts countenance upon me, and that my interest may be made clear before I depart:</hi> which I did; and about three or four hours after ſhe ſent for me again, and told me with rejoycing, <hi>That ſhe was ſatisfied, and willing that God ſhould do with her according to his pleaſure:</hi> only ſhe deſired, that I would repeat two or three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of a diſcourſe which I had a few dayes before delivered in her preſence at the burial of one who had in former times belonged to that family.

               </p>

               <p n="3">3. To die intereſted in the Lord, in his life, in his death, in his reſurrection; theſe that die thus, may be ſaid to be <hi>Bleſſed:</hi> This was it that the Apoſtle laboured for; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9, 10. <hi>Thar he might gain Chriſt,</hi> that is, <hi>that he might be found in him; not having his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through faith in Chriſt: that he might know him, and the power of his reſurrection, and the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of his ſufferings, being made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his death:</hi> Theſe things ſhe deſired to make familiar to her before ſhe went hence; which I hoped gave her ſuch a diſcovery of the art of dying, that Satan did but aſſault in vain: indeed he uſually gives a ſore charge before he fall; ſo he did here; he then rages, when he ſees he is paſt hopes: he ſtruggles hard, when he ſees he muſt quit claim and uſurpation of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as he doth in the firſt breathing of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting work, when he ſees he muſt quit poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
